Usage: versiond-router-fleet.sh COMMAND [ARGS]

Commands:
  spec-hash          Print the canonical desired fleet specification SHA-256.
  prepare-networks   Create or validate the fleet-owned front/back networks.
  up                 Create missing slots or start existing containers unchanged.
  apply              Bootstrap an absent fleet or roll changed slots one at a time.
  rollout            Replace slots one at a time, preserving the ready reserve.
  maintenance-rollout
                     Drain the old fleet before a placement-contract change.
                     Rerun it after an interruption: slots already on the new
                     contract are kept, the rest are replaced. Rollback covers
                     the slots captured by the current run only.
  verify-admission [ROUTE ...]
                     Require every slot, and every listed live route, to be
                     admitted by the active parent proxy.
  versiond-routes     Print currently served and required versions.
  verify-member CONTAINER [ROUTE ...]
                     Wait for this member to be admitted on every router.
  verify-member-reserve CONTAINER [ROUTE ...]
                     Require another admitted member before stopping this one.
  wait-version VERSION
                     Wait until every slot has learned VERSION and the configured
                     ready reserve is admitted end to end. This is the
                     post-approval acceptance gate for release automation.
  status             Show the expected fleet and reject duplicate/orphan slots.
  stop SLOT          Gracefully stop one slot after checking the ready reserve.
  start SLOT         Start an existing container unchanged, or create it if absent.
  stop-all --maintenance
                     Gracefully stop every fleet container for host maintenance.
  down --maintenance Remove all fleet containers, including orphan slots, and
                     remove fleet-owned networks after the main stack is down.

Configuration comes from config.env. VERSIOND_ROUTER_FLEET_SLOTS defaults to
"0 1 2"; every slot generation is its own Compose project
(<prefix>-<slot>-<generation>). While a replacement is uncommitted, the
previous generation of the slot stays as a stopped container: a rollback
starts exactly what served before, and a rerun after an interruption finds
that record in Docker itself.
