# Inference lifecycle and state-leaning design

Design-decisions summary. The corresponding implementation plans live
in the two companion documents and are not repeated here:

- [remove-reveal-seed.md](./remove-reveal-seed.md) — RevealSeed removal.
- [inferences-pruning.md](./inferences-pruning.md) — in-memory and
  state-root pruning of inference records.

These changes share one underlying observation: once the commit-reveal
phase is gone, the chain no longer needs devshard to keep inference
state alive past the moment the local validation window closes. We can
therefore stop carrying inference records in RAM, stop hashing them
into the state root, and rely on epoch-scoped payload retention instead
of per-inference payload deletes.

## 1. Remove the RevealSeed phase

### What changes

`MsgRevealSeed`, `state.RevealedSeeds`, `recomputeCompliance`,
`penalizeUnrevealedSeeds`, and `allUniqueAddressesRevealed` are
removed from devshard's runtime. The `MsgRevealSeed` proto message
and its oneof slot are kept on the wire as a deprecated, inert tx so
that persisted diffs and stale-binary gossip still decode cleanly.
`PhaseFinalizing → PhaseSettlement` becomes deadline-only:

```
deadlinePassed := LatestNonce >= FinalizeNonce + uint64(len(group))
```

The `DeriveSeed` / `ShouldValidate(ownSeed, …)` path is **kept**: each
host still picks its own subset of inferences to validate using a
locally derived seed. Only the *reveal* half goes away.

### Why this is safe

The reveal path fed two settlement fields on
`DevshardSettlementHostStats` — `RequiredValidations` and
`CompletedValidations`. These propagate into `DevshardHostEpochStats`
on the chain side and are **never read** by any chain code: no
slashing, no reward adjustment, no downtime check, no eviction. The
chain's slashing logic uses `MissedRequests` (executor failures) and
participant status. So the entire commit-reveal cycle was bookkeeping
that cost gas on every session and changed nothing observable
on chain.

Both fields stay on `HostStats`/`HostStatsProto` and are sent as
zero, keeping the wire format bit-identical with
`DevshardSettlementHostStats`. No chain code changes.

### Operational consequences

- Coordinated upgrade, not rolling. Mixed binaries in one group
  diverge on state root and fail to assemble a settlement quorum.
- Sessions are not resumable across the cutover: removing
  `RevealedSeeds` from the state hash preimage changes the state
  root, and pre-upgrade persisted snapshots
  (`storage.SaveSnapshot` from `storage-design.md`) are not
  forward-compatible. New sessions only.
- Loss of compliance observability: the existing chain query keeps
  returning `RequiredValidations` / `CompletedValidations` constantly
  at zero.
- Host-local **validation observability** (outside the state root, exposed
  on `GET /devshard/stats/shards/{escrow_id}` — prefer the versionless path;
  legacy `/devshard/{version}/stats/shards/...` is rewritten internally) is
  populated when signed diffs are applied; see
  [validation-observability-diff-apply.md](./validation-observability-diff-apply.md).

## 2. Drop inference records from RAM and state

### What changes

`Mutable.Inferences` no longer accumulates records for the lifetime of
a session. A record is evicted from RAM the moment the host seals that
inference (see §4 for the seal triggers). The diff log remains the
canonical source of truth, so any record can be rematerialized from disk
if a late, post-eviction tx legitimately needs it.

A small, durable per-inference index is maintained for the *only*
protocol path that may legitimately fire after eviction: the dedup /
verdict update in `applyValidation` for a late `MsgValidation`. This
index is a new `inferences` table inside the existing devshard
**session storage** (`devshard/storage/`, partitioned by `epoch_id`
alongside diffs and signatures — see
[storage-design.md](./storage-design.md)). It is host-local
bookkeeping derived from the diff log, not part of the state root.
Every other apply path resolves a missing record from a 32-byte
in-memory commit-hash discriminator (which doubles as the input to
the state-root hash) and either continues, rejects, or no-ops
without touching disk.

This is delivered in two phases:

- **Phase 0** — host-local. RAM is pruned. The per-inference durable
  index is added. The state root is **byte-identical** to today,
  because the same record content is fed into the inference hash via
  the commit-hash cache. No session-version bump.
- **Phase 1** — chain-coordinated. The inference hash composition is
  changed so it is computed from a rolling sealed accumulator plus
  the (now bounded) live set, instead of a full materialization of
  every record ever issued. Late `MsgValidation` becomes a
  deterministic reject. Requires a session-version bump and
  governance allowlisting of the new binary.

### Why this is safe

After an inference reaches a terminal status
(`StatusValidated` / `StatusInvalidated` / `StatusTimedOut`), the
only remaining protocol use of its in-memory record is `applyValidation`'s
late-dedup. Late `MsgValidationVote` is already a silent no-op.
Validation throughput is bounded by `ValidationRate`, and
post-terminal arrivals are even rarer (gossip catch-up only), so
hydrating that one cold-path tx from disk is acceptable.

Phase 0 keeps the state root unchanged by feeding the same
`InferenceRecord` bytes (via 32-byte commits) into the same hash
composition. Phase 1 changes the composition deliberately, under a
new version tag, with the chain treating `rest_hash` as opaque and
relying on the 2/3+1 host signature over `state_root` for
authenticity.

### Operational consequences

- Steady-state RAM is bounded by the **live** set (in-flight +
  in-grace), not by the lifetime inference count. State-root
  recomputation also walks only the live set plus a 32-byte commit
  per ever-issued id.
- Recovery treats the durable index as derived data: cold start
  truncates and rebuilds it from the diff log; snapshot-based recovery
  loads the live set and trusts the index for sealed rows.
- Phase 1 requires a coordinated rollout (binary version v2 plus
  chain-side allowlist) and pins composition per-binary, not
  per-session.

## 3. Payload retention is epoch-scoped, not per-inference

### What changes

Devshard executor payloads (prompt / response bytes) live in
`common/storage/payloads` inside **devshardd**, keyed by
`(escrow_id, inference_id, epoch_id)`.

**Single versiond / local dev:** when `PGHOST` is unset, payloads are stored as
files under `{data-dir}/payloads` (same policy as `decentralized-api/payloadstorage`
on `devshard-0.2.13-v2-r2`).

**Multi versiond / rolling overlap:** shared Postgres is required; see
`devshard/docs/storage-design.md` (payload storage section).
`(escrow_id, inference_id, epoch_id)`. There is **no** per-inference
delete when an inference is sealed. Payloads are reclaimed only when
devshardd drops an entire epoch partition on a new block:

```
expiredPayloadEpoch := currentEpoch - 3   // retain last 3 epochs
payloadStore.DropEpoch(expiredPayloadEpoch)
```

Sealing an inference (§4) updates session storage (`InsertSealedInference`)
and evicts the live RAM record, but leaves payload bytes in place until
the epoch partition is dropped.

Mainnet executor payloads in **decentralized-api**
(`decentralized-api/payloadstorage/`) are a separate subsystem with its
own epoch `PruneEpoch` / `ManagedStorage` retention policy. It is not
coupled to devshard host sealing.

A validator that fetches a payload after the epoch partition has been
dropped receives an HTTP 404 from the executor and **skips silently**:
no `MsgValidation`, no challenge, no failure record.

### Why this is safe

Validation feedback is invisible to the chain after the RevealSeed
removal (§1). A validator that arrives too late to find the payload
has no on-chain consequence whether it fails, retries, or skips, so
"skip and log" is the cheapest correct behavior. Three epochs of
retention is enough for normal validation catch-up; the partition drop
is deterministic from the chain epoch counter, not from host-local
seal timing.

### Operational consequences

- Payload disk / Postgres pressure scales with epoch throughput, not
  with per-inference seal timing. Worst-case retention is roughly
  three chain epochs of executor traffic.
- No proto bumps, no new chain txs, no state-root impact from payload
  cleanup. Epoch drops run in devshardd on every new block once
  `currentEpoch >= 4`.

## 4. Seal triggers — when an inference leaves live RAM

The same set of triggers drives in-RAM eviction and the durable sealed
index write. They are evaluated inside the state machine (`autoSealLocked`
during `ApplyDiff`) and persisted by the host in `applyAndPersist` after
the diff has been applied.

### Trigger A — terminal status

An applied diff transitions an inference to
`StatusValidated`, `StatusInvalidated`, or `StatusTimedOut`. There is
no further protocol path that needs the live inference record. Fired by:

- `applyValidation` flipping `Status` from `Finished` / `Challenged`
  to `Validated` / `Invalidated`,
- `applyTimeoutInference` flipping to `TimedOut`.

### Trigger B — settlement entry

`PhaseFinalizing → PhaseSettlement` transitions (deadline-only after
§1). At that point no further `MsgValidation`, `MsgChallenge`, or
`MsgValidationVote` will be accepted by the state machine. The host
seals every inference still in `StatusFinished` or `StatusChallenged`.

### Trigger C — stale-finished grace (temporary)

An inference that finished during the Active phase but was never
touched by a validation, challenge, or timeout. The host seals it
only when **both** of:

- enough nonces have passed since `MsgFinishInference`
  (`InferenceSealGraceNonces`, governance-pinned at session create, default
  `10 * len(group)` with floor 20), and
- enough wall-clock time has passed since the host observed that
  finish (`InferenceSealGraceSeconds`, governance-pinned at session
  create, default `3600` seconds / 1 hour).

A two-gate is needed because nonce growth is traffic-dependent — at
high throughput a nonce-only gate collapses to near-zero wall-clock
time, which is unsafe in the face of late validators or
challenge-induced voting that may still need the payload to verify.
A wall-clock-only gate is unsafe in the opposite direction at low
traffic. Both must pass.

**Trigger C is explicitly a temporary measure.** It is the only
trigger that seals an inference whose validation outcome is still
formally undecided. It is justified today only because the chain
does not act on missed validations (§1) and the validation protocol
treats every host's verdict as advisory. The intent is to **redesign
the validation protocol** so that an inference's live-state retention
requirement is bounded by a protocol-visible event (e.g. an explicit
"validation window closed" message or an on-chain commitment), at
which point Trigger C disappears.

Under v2 composition, **Trigger A** uses the same nonce and
wall-clock gates before sealing post-terminal inferences
(delayed seal after terminal). The grace values are frozen in
`SessionConfig` at session create (from chain `DevshardEscrowParams`
via `GetEscrow`) and do not feed into the state root, so adjusting
governance defaults only affects newly created sessions.

## 5. Cross-cutting consequences

- **Validator behavior on missing payload.** A 404 from the executor
  is mapped to a sentinel skip both at the validator side and at the
  host's `validateAsync` loop, so the host produces no
  `MsgValidation` and the validator does not retry the same id.
- **Diff replay on recovery.** The diff log is canonical and is
  replayed on cold start. Tier A and B seals naturally re-fire on
  the same terminal transitions and settlement entry. Tier C's
  bookkeeping is host-local and not persisted, so inferences that
  finished before a snapshot are not Tier-C-eligible after recovery
  from that snapshot — Tier A, Tier B, and the epoch partition drop
  remain the backstops.
- **Storage layering.** Three independent retention paths:
  - **devshardd payload storage** (`common/storage/payloads`) — epoch
    partition drop on new block (`DropEpoch` at `currentEpoch - 3`).
  - **dapi payload storage** (`decentralized-api/payloadstorage/`) —
    mainnet executor payloads; `ManagedStorage` epoch prune only.
  - **devshard session storage** (`devshard/storage/`) — diffs,
    signatures, and the sealed `inferences` index. Sealing writes
    one row to the index and removes the live `Mutable.Inferences`
    entry from future snapshots; payload bytes are untouched.
  Epoch-level partition drops in payload storage and `PruneEpoch` in
  session storage remain the long-tail reclamation path for everything
  else.
- **Wire compatibility.** No proto field is renumbered, removed, or
  reinterpreted by §1. §2 Phase 1 is gated by a binary
  version tag that the chain allowlists; v1 and v2 share the same
  opaque-`rest_hash` settlement shape, so chain code does not branch
  on the tag.
