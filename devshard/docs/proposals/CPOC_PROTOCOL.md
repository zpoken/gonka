# cPoC skip protocol (devshard) — proposal

## Summary

In a **devshard**, hosts that run **confirmation PoC (cPoC)** must **not** serve normal inference for the duration of their PoC obligation. Other hosts must be able to tell whether a skip is **legitimate** (the skipping host is on the **cPoC schedule** at the relevant height) or **abusive** (lying, or refusing work). This document specifies the **data flow** and the **cases** that the cPoC protocol must handle.

The core idea that hosts know mainnet heights and there is (out of scope) concensus mechanism to agree on that heights. Hosts bind nonces to heights, but only to nonces they know. If host served request with `nonce_A` it binds it to `H_A(host)`, the next nonce served by this host will be `nonce_B` = `nonce_A + slots_num`. So every nonce between `nonce_A` and `nonce_B` from the hosts view is between known to host `H_A(host)` and `H_B(host)`. And there are nonces where some other host skips the inference because of performing cPoC. So the other hosts can verify, if this skip was valid or not.

**Out of scope for this document:**

- **How each host obtains / agrees on mainnet height.** That is solved by **[HEIGHT_SYNC_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md](./HEIGHT_SYNC_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md)** (Omit / Anchor / Strong, deferred checks, etc.). Here we **assume** each host has a scalar `**H(host)**` equal to the **height known to the majority of validators / devshard hosts** (its own follower + height-sync rules have converged on that value). Discrepancies at the level handled by the height-sync spec are **that spec’s problem**; this document only distinguishes the cases where such a discrepancy **affects a cPoC verdict** and defers the discrepancy itself to height sync.
- **Mainnet settlement / slashing math** — out of scope; this doc emits **verdicts** (`Valid` / `Invalid` / `Inconclusive`) and hands evidence to [FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md](./FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md).

It may be easier to understand this proposal through worked examples; see [Cases to handle (case / dataflow)](#cases-to-handle-case--dataflow).

**Status:** draft — **data flow + cases** specified below; wire schemas, chain hooks, and slashing predicates still TBD.

## Shared assumptions (informative)

1. **Height oracle (provided by height sync, treated as black box here):** Each host `**V`** exposes a scalar `**H(V)**` — the mainnet height **known to the majority of validators / devshard hosts** as of `**V`**’s latest convergence with the height-sync layer. This doc **does not** re-specify how `H(V)` is computed, trusted, or refreshed; see [HEIGHT_SYNC_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md](./HEIGHT_SYNC_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md). When this doc says “height `**H`**” without qualification, read it as `**H(V)` at the moment `V` evaluates the case**.
2. **cPoC schedule:** Given a host `**H_i`** and a mainnet height `**H**`, there exists a deterministic predicate `**Schedule(H_i, H) ∈ {idle, prepare, active}**` derivable from chain / epoch state by anyone with that height. Semantics of `prepare` vs `active` are defined in the chain-side cPoC spec and out of scope here.
3. **Executor schedule:** Requests in a session are ordered by a **monotonic nonce** (linear increment). With `**N_slots`** slots and fixed mapping `**executor(nonce) = hosts[nonce mod N_slots]**`, the same logical slot recurs at `**nonce + N_slots**` (one **round**).
4. **Asynchronous developer traffic:** The developer **does not** wait for a host response before sending the next request. A response to a request at `**R_req`** is merged into the session's **linearized diff** at some later nonce `**R_req + x`**, `**x ≥ 0**` — not necessarily the same nonce. Any nonce-bound rule must work on **the nonce at which a message appears in `Diff`**, not on wall-clock pairing with the outbound request.

### Notation (nonces used throughout)

All nonces below are monotonic indices into `Diff` (Data flow § Per-session local state). They are defined here once so later sections can reference them without re-introducing each.

## Problem statement

### 1. Skip correctness

A host that returns **“skipping because of cPoC”** may be:

- **Honest** — `Schedule(H_i, H) ∈ {prepare, active}` and `H_i ∉ PoC_slot_set`, or
- **Malicious** — returning `CPoC_SKIP` while **not** scheduled / while in `PoC_slot_set` (avoids work).

The protocol must let every honest verifier `**V`** reach the same verdict from the **same diff**, using `**H(V)`** as the height oracle (assumption **1**).

### 2. Developer replay / withholding

A developer could **hold** a host's cPoC skip response and later attach it via `CarrySkip`. Mitigation is layered:

- **At the cPoC verdict layer (this doc):** freshness is bounded **in mainnet heights**, not rounds, via the interval `I = [h_X, h_carry]` each verifier personally witnesses (§ Nonce binding). A late carry of a **genuine** skip blob remains `Valid` — it was truthful at a height in `I`; a late reveal does not retroactively make it a lie. Only skips that were **never** legitimate at any height in `I` produce `Invalid`.
- **At the settlement layer (out of scope here):** the remaining harm from late carries — inference records kept open, stale evidence used to stall settlement — is handled by `MsgTimeoutInference{…CPOC}` timeouts and finalization deadlines.

### 3. Gossip volume

Under high inference rate, if most hosts skip during cPoC, per-skip gossip is unacceptable:

- **No** gossip inside a normal round if diffs already propagate the evidence.
- **Dispute-grade** evidence rides on **[finalization / state sharing](./FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md)** rather than a parallel flood channel.

It is important that each host can participate in a lot of devshards, so gossip traffic is highly unwanted and is limited to disputes and settlement cases.

## Design principles (high level)

The formalization in § Data flow and the cases in § Cases to handle are chosen to satisfy the following principles. Nonce symbols (`R_req`, `N_SP`, `N_carry`, `X`, `N_slots`) are defined in **Shared assumptions → Notation**; `H(V)`, `Schedule`, and `PoC_slot_set` in **Shared assumptions** items 1–3; `timeout_skip_gossip` under § Gossip minimization.

### Two request paths

The developer chooses **one of two shapes** when opening a request, he can request with an inference and get cPoC skip response or can ckip in advance host that is doing cPoC; both converge on the same `Verdict` predicate.

**Path A — inference with possible cPoC refusal (full payload).** Developer submits a real inference request; the host either confirms and runs it, or refuses because of cPoC.

```
D → devshard : MsgStartInference(R_req, prompt_hash, …)   [into Diff at R_req]

  happy path → H_i → devshard : MsgConfirmStart(R_req)    [into Diff]
                               → … → MsgFinishInference

  cPoC   path → H_i → D : CPoCSkipResponse(R_req, reason) [p2p; NOT in Diff]
               D  → devshard  : CarrySkip(N_carry, <embedded CPoCSkipResponse>)
                                                    [into Diff at N_carry]
```

**Path B — lightweight skip probe (no prompt, no inference cost).** Developer asks `H_i` to report its cPoC state without paying a prompt. The host **does not execute inference**; it just returns a signed status. The response has **two possible outcomes**:

- *Refusal* — `H_i` is still on cPoC (`cpoc_active` or `cpoc_prepare`); behaves like a Path-A skip for verdict purposes.
- *Ready* — `H_i` has finished cPoC and is `READY_INFERENCE`; the developer should resume sending real `MsgStartInference` to `H_i`.

```
D  → devshard  : MsgSkipProbe(N_SP)                       [into Diff at N_SP]
H_i → D        : CPoCProbeResponse(N_SP, outcome ∈ {cpoc_active, cpoc_prepare, ready})         [p2p; NOT in Diff]
D  → devshard  : CarrySkip(N_carry, <embedded CPoCProbeResponse>)   [into Diff at N_carry]
                  # N_SP < N_carry strictly (two distinct Diff entries)
```

A `ready` outcome carried into `Diff` is **not** an `Invalid` skip — the verdict predicate simply does not apply (no refusal to validate). It is instead a **scheduling receipt**: V records that `H_i` signalled `ready` at a height in `[h_X, h_carry]`. Subsequent developer behaviour is checked against that receipt by **C13** (developer keeps probing / skipping a ready host — see § Cases).

> **Future optimization (deferred, see Open question §8).** Once `D` has a fresh `CarrySkip` proving `H_i` is on cPoC, subsequent skips of `H_i` within the same cPoC window should not need a full probe roundtrip: `D` can place a single developer-signed marker into `Diff` at `H_i`'s slot and route the real request to `H_{i+1}`. Collapses the three-message Path-B triple (`MsgSkipProbe` → `CPoCProbeResponse` → `CarrySkip`) to one D-signed entry per repeated skip. **Out of scope for this release**; the current doc specifies only the explicit-probe flow.

Key invariants shared by both paths:

- **Host responses are p2p and not directly observable by verifiers.** Whether `CPoCSkipResponse` (Path A refusal) or `CPoCProbeResponse` (Path B status), the host's signed statement only enters the verifier's field of view when the developer echoes it via `**CarrySkip`** into `Diff`.
- `**CarrySkip` is the primary verdict-bearing artifact in `Diff`.** Every `V` computes `Verdict` from `Diff[N_carry]`. For **Path A**, the predicate additionally scans `Diff` for a `MsgConfirmStart` matching the same `inference_id`; if one exists (in either direction relative to `N_carry`), the verdict is `Invalid` against `H_i` for double-claim (see § Verdict predicate, step 2, and § Cases → C2').
- **Two distinct `Diff` entries per path.** Both paths have `R_req < N_carry` (resp. `N_SP < N_carry`) strictly: different proto messages occupy different nonces, and the developer signature on `CarrySkip` binds bytes that only exist *after* the host's p2p response arrives.
- **Settlement is decoupled.** Once `CarrySkip` has reached a final `Verdict`, closing the inference record at chain level uses the existing `MsgTimeoutInference{reason = TIMEOUT_REASON_CPOC}` path (new enum value); this settlement step is **not** what the verdict depends on.

Everything below — nonce binding, gossip minimization, data flow, cases — applies to both paths uniformly; the only Path-B specialization is the additional `ready` outcome (and its follow-on case C13).

### Nonce binding (height-interval freshness)

Because of **asynchronous developer traffic** (Shared assumptions, item **5**), the response to a request sent at nonce `**R_req**` may appear in `Diff` only at nonce `**R_req + x**`, `**x ≥ 0**`. The delay `x` is **not bounded in rounds** — rounds can be far faster than mainnet blocks or host response, so many rounds may legitimately elapse between `R_req` and `N_carry`. Verdicts therefore bind to a **height interval** that each verifier constructs **locally** from its own observations of `Diff`:

- **Reference nonce** of a skip attestation = `**R_req**` (the request it answers), stated inside the signed `CPoCSkipResponse`. (Term chosen to avoid collision with the height-sync "Anchor", which is out of scope here.)
- **Carry nonce** = `**N_carry**` (the nonce at which `CarrySkip` is appended to `Diff` and becomes visible to verifiers).
- **Witness nonce `X`** = the **latest nonce `≤ R_req`** whose executor is `V` itself — a nonce V personally handled, so `height_at[X]` is a height V actually observed no later than `R_req`. The exact formula (same round vs. previous round, depending on `SP_v` vs. `SP_e`) and its derivation are given in § Verdict predicate, step 1.
- **Height interval `I = [h_X, h_carry]`** where `h_X := height_at[X]` and `h_carry := height_at[N_carry] = H(V)` at ingest of `Diff[N_carry]`. This interval **bounds the set of mainnet heights** at which the host's skip could physically have been produced, as seen through **this** verifier's local clock.
- **Legitimacy test (anti-cheat, not anti-replay).** The skip is legitimate iff **∃ H ∈ I : `Schedule(H_i, H) ∈ {prepare, active}`**. If no height in `I` places `H_i` on the cPoC schedule, the skip could not have been truthful at any moment `V` witnessed → `Invalid` against `H_i`. A stale but genuine skip blob replayed well after the host returned to `READY_INFERENCE` is **still `Valid`** — the host was legitimately refusing at some height in `I`; a late carry does not retroactively make it a lie. (Replay / withholding harms settlement, not the cPoC verdict — see § Consensus / voting and the settlement-only row in the primitives table.)
- **Height attribution is local only.** Each verifier computes `h_X` and `h_carry` from its own `height_at[·]` map; the developer's or host's claimed height in `CPoCSkipResponse` is informational and is **not** input to the verdict.

### Gossip minimization

1. **Round-based elision (high load):** If within `timeout_skip_gossip` after `N_carry` the session advances to `N_carry + N_slots` (one full round), every honest verifier has seen the evidence via the diff. No dedicated gossip is emitted.
2. **Timeout-based gossip (low load):** Otherwise, any `V` with a non-`Valid` verdict **MAY** emit a compact `SkipEvidenceGossip` pointing into `Diff`. Peers re-run the verdict predicate locally.
3. **Finalization alignment:** Global, dispute-grade evidence rides with [FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md](./FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md) rather than a parallel flood channel.

Parameter `**timeout_skip_gossip`** (proposal: **≈ 2** mainnet blocks) is **chain-parametrized**; its exact value is out of scope here.

## Data flow (conceptual)

When a host skips inference because of confirmation PoC, every other host can tell if that skip was honest or cheating—without flooding gossip.

The session is an append-only log of messages, each at a monotonic nonce. Everyone reasons from what landed in `Diff`, not from private p2p alone. Verifiers see host answers only after the developer carries them into `Diff`. **`CarrySkip` is the verdict-bearing artifact**.

**Two ways to open a skip**

1. **Path A** — Real inference: MsgStartInference at R_req → host refuses on p2p (CPoCSkipResponse) → developer puts it on-chain in session as CarrySkip at N_carry.
2. **Path B** — Lightweight probe: MsgSkipProbe at N_SP → host answers on p2p (CPoCProbeResponse: still on cPoC or ready) → same CarrySkip at N_carry.

**How verifiers judge (each host V locally)**
When `V` ingests `Diff[N_carry]`:

1. Build a **mainnet height interval** `I = [h_X, h_carry]` from heights `V` recorded when it processed earlier nonces (witness nonce `X` ≤ request, carry at `N_carry`).
2. Check schedule: was `H_i` actually on cPoC (`prepare/active`) at some height in `I`? If never → **Invalid** (lying skip). If yes → **Valid** (even if carried late—anti-cheat, not anti-replay).
3. **Path A extra**: If the same host also sent MsgConfirmStart for that inference → **Invalid** (double claim).
4. Optional **Inconclusive** if this verifier's **local block oracle** has not yet covered the interval endpoints (or is stale).

**Votes & settlement**
Non-Valid verdicts → signed CPoCVote → quorum / finalization.

Usually **no extra gossip**: the diff propagates the evidence. Gossip is a rare fallback when the session is slow to advance one full executor round.

| `**pending_verdicts**`  | Buffer of skip attestations ingested from `Diff` whose `Verdict` is not yet final, keyed by `(R_req, N_carry)`. Three reasons an entry sits here: (a) `**Inconclusive**` — `I`'s endpoints (`h_X`, `h_carry`) are not yet covered by **this verifier's local oracle** (or the oracle is stale; see C6 / height-sync §17); (b) `**Invalid**` awaiting the round-elision / gossip deadline (C9/C10); (c) `**provisional**` within the **seal window** `[h_carry, h_carry + W_seal]` used by step (2) of the Verdict predicate — a `MsgConfirmStart` for the same `inference_id` may still arrive and flip the verdict to `Invalid` (C2'). Note that `Diff[X]` is **always** present by the time `Diff[N_carry]` is ingested (because `X ≤ R_req ≤ N_carry` and `Diff` is append-only), so `h_X` is always immediately computable — no "wait for witness" deferral exists. Each entry holds: `N_carry`, `R_req`, skipping host `H_i`, raw signed host response (`CPoCSkipResponse` or refusal-outcome `CPoCProbeResponse`), current tentative verdict (if any), `provisional_until` mainnet height (when reason (c) applies), and the resolution key/deadline. Entries are removed on commit: `Valid` → drop after the seal window expires; `Invalid` → hand to finalization. `ready`-outcome carries never enter this buffer — they are recorded directly in `ready_at` (below). |
| `**ready_at**`          | Map `host → (N_carry, h_carry, reset_height?)` recording the latest `CPoCProbeResponse(outcome = ready)` for each host, from the most recent `CarrySkip` in `Diff` with `payload_kind = probe_response` and `outcome = ready`. Consumed by case **C13** (developer withholding from a ready host). Cleared for `H_i` when V later observes either (a) `Schedule(H_i, H) ∈ {active, prepare}` strictly confirmed for some `H > h_carry`, or (b) a fresh non-`ready` `CPoCProbeResponse` / `CPoCSkipResponse` for `H_i` carried into `Diff`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `**withholding_alert`** | Per-`(D, H_i)` flag set by V when the C13 violation predicate fires on local `Diff` observations; cleared per C13 flow step 5.

### Verdict predicate (normative shape)

`V` computes `**Verdict(skip_evidence) ∈ {Valid, Invalid, Inconclusive}**` as:

1. **Causality and height-interval construction.** Applied to the **first** `CarrySkip` in `Diff` that references `R_req` (see "First-carry rule" below):
  - **Causality:** `R_req ≤ N_carry`. A `CarrySkip` cannot reference a request that has not yet entered `Diff`. Failure → `Invalid` **against the carrier** (developer signature on `CarrySkip`), not against `H_i`.
  - **Witness nonce `X`** (per § Design principles → Nonce binding). Let `SP_e = R_req mod N_slots`, `SP_v = v_slot`, `round(R_req) = ⌊R_req / N_slots⌋`. Then:
    - If `SP_v ≤ SP_e` → `X = round(R_req) · N_slots + SP_v` (same round as `R_req`, `X ≤ R_req`).
    - If `SP_v > SP_e` → `X = (round(R_req) − 1) · N_slots + SP_v` (**previous** round, `X < R_req`). Taking V's slot in the current round would reference a nonce **after** `R_req`; its `height_at` would be observed *after* `R_req` and could not lower-bound `H_skip`. Stepping back one round gives the latest executor-of-`V` nonce ≤ `R_req`.
    - Closed form used in pseudocode: `X = R_req − ((SP_e − SP_v) mod N_slots)`.
  - **Interval endpoints:**
    - `h_X := height_at[X]` — V's local height when it ingested `Diff[X]`. By construction `X ≤ R_req`, so `h_X` was observed no later than the request itself.
    - `h_carry := height_at[N_carry] = H(V)` at ingest of `Diff[N_carry]`.
    - **Invariants** (sanity, not failure modes): `h_X ≤ h_carry` (heights are monotonic at ingest), and `h_carry ≤ H(V)_now` (trivially — V is ingesting `N_carry` right now and stamps `h_carry` from `H(V)_now`).
  - `**Diff[X]` is always available when `Diff[N_carry]` is being ingested.** By construction `X ≤ R_req`, and causality (checked first in this step) requires `R_req ≤ N_carry`, so `X ≤ N_carry`. Because `Diff` is append-only and ingested in order, every `Diff[k]` with `k ≤ N_carry` is already present when V processes `Diff[N_carry]`.
  - **Bootstrap edge case.** The only situation in which `X` does not identify a real prior executor-slot of V is `round(R_req) = 0 ∧ SP_v > SP_e`, where the closed form yields `X < 0` — V had no executor slot before `R_req` in this session. V then falls back to the implicit session-start anchor (the lowest nonce V has ingested, typically 0) as the lower endpoint `h_X`. This is a cold-start condition only; it does not recur once V has executed at least once.
  - **Output** of this step: the height interval `**I := [h_X, h_carry]`**, consumed by step (4).
   The correct bound is in mainnet heights, and each verifier derives it from heights **it personally observed** (`h_X` and `h_carry`) — no cross-host height assumption required.
   **First-carry rule.** If the developer publishes multiple `CarrySkip` entries for the same `R_req`, only the **earliest** `N_carry` in `Diff` is admitted as input to the verdict; later duplicates are **ignored** (they may still be recorded for developer-misbehavior accounting, out of scope for this predicate). This keeps `I` deterministic across verifiers.
   **Path B.** For `MsgSkipProbe` (case **C7**) the rule is identical, with `R_req := N_SP` (the probe nonce) and `N_SP < N_carry` strictly. `CarrySkip` may wrap either a `CPoCSkipResponse` (refusal) or a `CPoCProbeResponse` (status). If the carried outcome is `ready`, steps (3–4) of the Verdict predicate do not apply (no refusal to evaluate); the carry is instead recorded as a **scheduling receipt** consumed by case **C13**.
   **Worked examples** (let `N_slots = 4`, `V`'s slot `SP_v = v_slot = 2`):

2. **Confirm-Skip mutual exclusion (Path A only).** The host cannot both **confirm** and **refuse** the same inference. Applied only when the `CarrySkip` envelope has `payload_kind = skip_response` (Path A); skipped for Path B (`payload_kind = probe_response`, which references `N_SP` and has no `inference_id` to collide). Procedure:
  - Let `inference_id* := Diff[R_req].inference_id` — read from the original `MsgStartInference` entry (which must already be in `Diff` by causality, step 1).
  - Scan `Diff` for any entry satisfying `kind = MsgConfirmStart ∧ inference_id = inference_id* ∧ executor = H_i`. Call the matching nonce `N_confirm` if found.
  - **No match** → proceed to step (3).
  - **Match with `N_confirm < N_carry`** → `Invalid` **against `H_i`**, `reason_code = double_claim_confirm_then_skip`. The host confirmed the inference (and therefore ran it, or must have intended to) and then signed a contradictory `CPoCSkipResponse` that `D` later carried. This is a cryptographically provable lie: both the `MsgConfirmStart.executor_sig` and the embedded `CPoCSkipResponse` signature are `H_i`'s.
  - **Match with `N_confirm > N_carry`** (confirm appears *after* the carry) → `Invalid` **against `H_i`**, `reason_code = double_claim_skip_then_confirm`. Symmetric violation: the host refused the request, then later confirmed and ran the same inference.
  - **Sealing window.** Because `MsgConfirmStart` for `inference_id*` may arrive *after* V has already ingested `N_carry` and computed a verdict, the verdict from step (4) is **provisional** for `W_seal` mainnet blocks after `h_carry` (`W_seal` is chain-parametrized — propose ≈ `2` blocks, matching `timeout_skip_gossip`). During the seal window, if a contradictory `MsgConfirmStart` lands, V re-runs the predicate and emits a **superseding `CPoCVote`** keyed on `(N_carry, V_pubkey)` (§ Consensus / voting); the collector keeps only the latest. After `W_seal` expires the verdict is final and this step stops re-firing; any post-seal `MsgConfirmStart` is a settlement-layer issue, not a cPoC verdict flip. V tracks the seal window via a `provisional_until[N_carry] = h_carry + W_seal` entry attached to `pending_verdicts`.
  - **Defence in depth at ingest (optional but cheap).** The devshard ingest layer SHOULD refuse to append (i) a `MsgConfirmStart` for `inference_id` if a `CarrySkip` whose embedded skip-response references the corresponding `R_req` already exists in `Diff`, and (ii) a `CarrySkip(payload_kind = skip_response)` referencing `R_req` if `MsgConfirmStart(inference_id = Diff[R_req].inference_id)` already exists. Because `Diff` ordering is already deterministic, this rejection is a pure function of `Diff` and race-free. With this rule active the scan above catches only the seal-window race.
3. **Role check.** `H_i ∉ PoC_slot_set`. Otherwise → `Invalid` (host had `POC_SLOT = true`, must not skip).
4. **Schedule check over interval `I`.**
  - `∃ H ∈ I : Schedule(H_i, H) ∈ {prepare, active}` → **candidate** `Valid` (subject to (5)). The host was legitimately on cPoC at **some** height V personally witnessed in `I`; that is sufficient.
  - `∀ H ∈ I : Schedule(H_i, H) == idle` → **candidate** `Invalid` (subject to (5)). The host claims cPoC refusal but is not on the schedule at any height in `I`.
5. **Height freshness at ingest.** If the endpoints of `I` (`h_X` and `h_carry`) are covered by **this verifier's local block oracle** and that oracle is not stale, commit to the candidate from (4). If either endpoint is not yet covered (or the oracle is stale), and the schedule verdict is adversarial (`Invalid`), V **MUST** hold the verdict as `Inconclusive` until the local oracle covers `I` — then re-run step (4). Do **not** wait on a withdrawn envelope-originator `(C-quorum)` / `IsStrictlyConfirmed` API ([height-sync §17](./HEIGHT_SYNC_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md#17-height-readiness)). Slash only via the usual **verifier vote quorum**.
6. **Signature / binding.** `CPoCSkipResponse` must be validly signed by `H_i` and reference `R_req` as it appears in `Diff`.

## Cases to handle (case / dataflow)

Legend: `R_req` = Path-A inference-request nonce (or, in Path B, aliased to the probe nonce `N_SP`); `N_carry` = nonce at which `CarrySkip` is appended to `Diff`; both paths have `R_req < N_carry` strictly. `R` denotes the executor round of size `N_slots`.

### C1 — Honest skip, honest developer (happy path)

**Setup:** `Schedule(H_i, H(V)) = active`, `H_i ∉ PoC_slot_set`, dev behaves normally.

**Flow:**

```
D → H_i       : InferenceRequest(R_req)
H_i → D       : CPoCSkipResponse(R_req, active)
D → H_{i+1}   : next InferenceRequest at R_req+1 carrying skip blob
                (or separate CarrySkip at some N_carry ≥ R_req)
V (= any host): on Diff[N_carry] → Verdict = Valid (nonce window + schedule)
```

**Expected verdict:** `**Valid`**. No gossip, no finalization trigger.

### C2 — Malicious host, fake skip

**Setup:** `Schedule(H_i, H(V)) = idle`, `H_i ∉ PoC_slot_set`, but `H_i` replies `CPoCSkipResponse` to avoid work.

**Flow:** Same as C1 up to the point the developer publishes `CarrySkip`. Each host `V` then:

```
V on Diff[N_carry]:
  compute Verdict(...) = Invalid                         # Schedule check fails at I
  emit CPoCVote(N_carry, verdict = Invalid, signed_by=V) # p2p to D (and optionally gossip)
D collects CPoCVote messages from distinct hosts:
  if |votes(Invalid)| ≥ quorum_invalid:
    verdict is settled as Invalid
    D hands the vote bundle to finalization (today)
    — OR —
    hosts publish votes at the next finalization round (future release; see § Consensus / voting)
```

**Expected verdict:** **`Invalid`** (Schedule check fails on the height interval `I`). The `Invalid` outcome is not attached to finalization by one party; it is the **quorum of `CPoCVote`s** from hosts that observed `Diff[N_carry]` and independently reached the same verdict. See § Consensus / voting for the vote-collection protocol and the "developer today / self-finalization tomorrow" split.

### C2' — Double-claim fraud (confirm and skip the same request)

**Setup:** `H_i` signs **both** a `MsgConfirmStart` and a `CPoCSkipResponse` for the same `inference_id` (directly or via `D` carrying the skip blob). The two messages are cryptographically incompatible: `MsgConfirmStart.executor_sig` commits `H_i` to running the inference, and the embedded `CPoCSkipResponse` commits `H_i` to refusing it. Applicable only to **Path A** (`payload_kind = skip_response`); Path B has no `inference_id` on the carry and cannot trigger this case.

**Flow (confirm before carry):**

```
Diff[R_req]      : MsgStartInference(inference_id = I)
Diff[N_confirm]  : MsgConfirmStart(inference_id = I, executor = H_i)   # H_i claims "I ran it"
... time passes ...
Diff[N_carry]    : CarrySkip embedding CPoCSkipResponse(reference_nonce = R_req,
                                                        signed by H_i)  # contradicts confirm

V on ingest of Diff[N_carry]:
  Verdict predicate, step 2:
    inference_id* = Diff[R_req].inference_id = I
    scan Diff → found MsgConfirmStart(I, H_i) at N_confirm < N_carry
    ⇒ Invalid against H_i (reason_code = double_claim_confirm_then_skip)
  emit CPoCVote(Invalid, target = host(H_i), reason_code = …)
```

**Flow (skip carried first, confirm arrives inside the seal window):**

```
Diff[R_req]      : MsgStartInference(inference_id = I)
Diff[N_carry]    : CarrySkip embedding CPoCSkipResponse(…, signed by H_i)
V on ingest:       provisional Valid (or Invalid on other grounds); records
                   provisional_until = h_carry + W_seal in pending_verdicts

... within the seal window ...
Diff[N_confirm]  : MsgConfirmStart(I, H_i)    # H_i claims the inference after refusing it

V on re-run of the predicate:
  step 2 detects N_confirm > N_carry within seal window
  ⇒ Invalid against H_i (reason_code = double_claim_skip_then_confirm)
  emit superseding CPoCVote — collector replaces V's prior vote for (N_carry, V_pubkey)
```

**Flow (confirm arrives after the seal window):**

```
Diff[N_carry]    : CarrySkip(...)                  # sealed Valid after W_seal
Diff[N_confirm]  : MsgConfirmStart(I, H_i)         # too late to flip the cPoC verdict

V:  does NOT re-open the settled verdict; the protocol violation is instead
    handed off to settlement (finalization) as stand-alone evidence that
    H_i signed two contradictory statements about inference I.
```

**Expected verdict:** `**Invalid` against `H_i`** whenever both artifacts land in `Diff` within the seal window of each other. Settled via the standard `CPoCVote` quorum (§ Consensus / voting), with the vote bundle carrying `reason_code ∈ {double_claim_confirm_then_skip, double_claim_skip_then_confirm}` and pointers to both `Diff` entries as the cryptographic evidence of the contradiction. Outside the seal window the violation is still slashable, but at the settlement layer rather than as a cPoC-predicate flip (keeps verdict finality bounded).

**Optional devshard-ingest hardening.** The devshard MAY refuse to append either message when the other already exists in `Diff` (Verdict predicate, step 2, "Defence in depth at ingest"). This shifts the rejection from the predicate layer to the gateway layer for the common case; the predicate's step 2 remains in force for the race window during which both messages can legitimately arrive at the ingest layer concurrently.

### C3 — Developer late carry (genuine skip, late)

**Setup:** `H_i` returned a legitimate `CPoCSkipResponse` at `R_req` during its cPoC window (height `H_skip`). Developer holds the blob for arbitrarily many rounds and later emits `CarrySkip` at `N_carry ≫ R_req`.

**Flow:**

```
D → devshard     : MsgStartInference(R_req)              # during H_i's cPoC window
H_i → D          : CPoCSkipResponse(R_req, active)        # p2p, signed by H_i at H_skip
... time passes; Diff advances; mainnet advances past H_skip ...
D → devshard     : CarrySkip(N_carry, CPoCSkipResponse)   # late carry
V on Diff[N_carry]:
  SP_e = R_req mod N_slots; SP_v = v_slot
  X = R_req − ((SP_e − SP_v) mod N_slots)     # same round if SP_v ≤ SP_e, else previous round
  h_X    = height_at[X]   (≈ H_skip — V's height observed at or before R_req)
  h_carry = H(V) at ingest of Diff[N_carry]
  I = [H_skip, h_carry]; Schedule(H_i, H_skip) ∈ {prepare, active} ⇒ step 3 passes
  Verdict = Valid
```

**Expected verdict:** `**Valid`**. The host's attestation is truthful for a height in `I`; lateness does not retroactively make it a lie. Any residual harm (inference record kept open, stalled settlement) is handled at the **settlement layer** (`MsgTimeoutInference{…CPOC}` and finalization deadlines), **not** by the cPoC verdict predicate.

### C3' — Causality failure (forged carry)

**Setup:** Developer publishes a `CarrySkip` with `N_carry < R_req` (references a request that has not yet entered `Diff`).

**Flow:** Step (1) of the verdict predicate rejects the envelope on the causality inequality `R_req ≤ N_carry`.

**Expected verdict:** `**Invalid`** against the **carrier** (developer signature on `CarrySkip`), **not** against `H_i`. This is a pure forgery check, independent of any height interval.

### C4 — `POC_SLOT = true` host returns skip

**Setup:** `H_i ∈ PoC_slot_set` (inference-exempt during others’ cPoC), yet replies `CPoCSkipResponse`.

**Flow:** any normal request/response leading to a carried skip.

**Expected verdict:** **`Invalid`** (Role check fails). Verdict is settled by **vote quorum** (see C2 / § Consensus / voting): every host computes the same `Invalid` and emits `CPoCVote`; the collected bundle is the evidence handed to slashing (`H_i`).

### C5 — Skip during `prepare` window

**Setup:** `Schedule(H_i, H(V)) = prepare` (policy-dependent).

**Decision:** Same verdict rules as `active`.

### C6 — Inconclusive due to height uncertainty

**Setup:** `Schedule(H_i, H(V)) = idle`, but **this verifier's local block oracle** has not yet covered the nonce-window endpoints (tip behind, or oracle stale).

**Flow:** Verdict step (5) returns `Inconclusive`.

**Expected action:** `V` **does not** emit a `CPoCVote` yet; it waits until its local oracle covers `I`. If the schedule then evaluates to `Invalid`, `V` emits `CPoCVote(Invalid)` and the standard vote-quorum flow (§ Consensus / voting) collects the bundle. If `Valid`, no vote is emitted and no action is taken. Envelope-originator tallies are **not** used ([height-sync §17](./HEIGHT_SYNC_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md#17-height-readiness)).

### C7 — Skip probe (Path B), refusal outcome

**Setup:** `D` wants a cPoC status check from `H_i` without submitting a prompt. `Schedule(H_i, H) ∈ {active, prepare}` at the height the probe is answered.

**Flow:**

```
D  → devshard  : MsgSkipProbe(N_SP, target = H_i)          # into Diff at N_SP
H_i → D        : CPoCProbeResponse(N_SP, outcome ∈
                   {cpoc_active, cpoc_prepare})            # p2p, signed by H_i
D  → devshard  : CarrySkip(N_carry, CPoCProbeResponse)     # into Diff at N_carry > N_SP
V on Diff[N_carry]:
  R_req := N_SP
  run the Verdict predicate (steps 1–5) unchanged
```

**Expected verdict:** `**Valid`** (same predicate as Path A, applied with `R_req := N_SP`).

### C7' — Skip probe (Path B), ready outcome

**Setup:** `D` probes `H_i`. `H_i` has **finished** its cPoC window and is in `READY_INFERENCE` (`Schedule(H_i, H) = idle` at the answering height).

**Flow:**

```
D  → devshard  : MsgSkipProbe(N_SP, target = H_i)
H_i → D        : CPoCProbeResponse(N_SP, outcome = ready)  # p2p, signed by H_i
D  → devshard  : CarrySkip(N_carry, CPoCProbeResponse)     # into Diff at N_carry > N_SP
V on Diff[N_carry]:
  detect payload_kind = probe_response AND outcome = ready
  record scheduling receipt: ready_at[H_i] = (N_carry, h_carry)
  Verdict predicate steps (2–3) do NOT apply (no refusal to evaluate)
```

**Expected verdict:** **not applicable.** The carry is a **scheduling receipt**, not a skip attestation. It obliges the developer to resume routing real `MsgStartInference` to `H_i` at subsequent `H_i`-slot nonces. Persistent deviation after this receipt triggers **C13**.

### C8 — No response at all (timeout)

**Setup:** `H_i` returns nothing (neither inference nor skip).

**Expected action:** Out of scope of cPoC-skip verdict. Governed by `**USER_TIMEOUT`** in [FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md](./FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md). cPoC protocol contributes **no** verdict in this case.

### C9 — Low-load vote collection (explicit gossip)

**Setup:** After `timeout_skip_gossip` the diff has not advanced one full round, so not every `V` has necessarily seen the carried skip and the vote collector (see § Consensus / voting) has not yet reached `quorum_invalid`.

**Flow:**

```
V1 emits SkipEvidenceGossip(Diff-refs) to peers           # lagging peers catch up on Diff
peers reconstruct Diff-refs, compute Verdict locally,
  and emit CPoCVote if their verdict is non-Valid
collector aggregates votes (`D` for host-fault cases this release; finalization round for developer-target votes when self-finalization exists — see § Consensus / voting)
```

**Expected verdict:** whatever the vote quorum declares on the same `Diff` evidence. `SkipEvidenceGossip` is a **delivery** aid only; it does not compute a verdict, it just makes the same `CarrySkip` visible so lagging peers can vote.

### C10 — High-load round elision

**Setup:** High request rate; the diff naturally advances past `R_req + N_slots` within `timeout_skip_gossip`.

**Expected action:** No `SkipEvidenceGossip` emission needed; every `V` has the evidence by construction. Each `V` independently computes `Verdict` and, if non-`Valid`, emits `CPoCVote`. The collector aggregates votes as usual.

### C11 — Dispute-grade evidence bundle

**Setup:** A verdict is `Invalid` (C2, **C2'**, C4, C6-confirmed-invalid, C3', or C13).

**Flow:** Once `quorum_invalid` is reached, the collector assembles an **evidence bundle** consisting of: (i) the refs into `Diff` for `MsgStartInference` / `MsgSkipProbe`, `CarrySkip`, and (for C13) the `H_i`-slot window; (ii) the set of `CPoCVote` messages achieving quorum; (iii) the relevant schedule inputs (`PoC_slot_set`, `Schedule` at heights in `I`). This bundle is handed to [FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md](./FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md) for inclusion in the finalization bundle for mainnet — the bundle is the input to slashing.

### C12 — Executor / schedule desync (verifier bug)

**Setup:** `V` has stale `PoC_slot_set` or wrong epoch schedule (not the network majority view).

**Expected behavior:** `V` is at fault for mis-verdict; this is a **node-operator** / epoch-refresh issue, **not** host fault. Recovery belongs to the schedule/epoch layer (out of scope). The protocol must log the conflict so operators can detect it; it must **not** penalize `H_i` when only an outlier `V` disagrees.

### C13 — Developer withholds work from a ready host (routing misbehavior)

**Setup:** Some host `H_i` has signalled `ready` (either via `CPoCProbeResponse(outcome = ready)` carried in `Diff` at some nonce `N_ready`, or because `Schedule(H_i, H) = idle` across the last `W_ready` mainnet blocks that every verifier strictly confirms). The developer is nonetheless **not** routing real inference to `H_i`:

- at nonces where `executor(n) = H_i` (i.e. `n mod N_slots = i`), `D` keeps sending `MsgSkipProbe(target = H_i)` rather than `MsgStartInference`, **or**
- `D` stops emitting messages at `H_i`-slot nonces altogether while continuing to send to other slots.

**Observation (at each `V`).** `V` counts, over a trailing window of `W_fair` rounds ending at the current nonce:

- `n_inf(H_i)` = `MsgStartInference` entries with `executor(n) = H_i`,
- `n_probe(H_i)` = `MsgSkipProbe` entries targeted at `H_i`,
- whether `H_i` is `ready` (per `ready_at[H_i]` receipt **or** `Schedule(H_i, H) = idle` for every `H ∈ [h_start_window, H(V)]`).

**Violation predicate.** `ready(H_i)` ∧ `n_probe(H_i) + n_miss(H_i) ≥ θ_fair` ∧ `n_inf(H_i) < θ_min_inf` — i.e. over the window, `D` sent probes or left `H_i`-slots empty at least `θ_fair` times while sending fewer than `θ_min_inf` real inferences to `H_i`, despite `H_i` being ready. Exact values `(W_fair, θ_fair, θ_min_inf)` are **chain-parametrized** (TBD; see Open questions).

**Flow:**

```
1. Diff[N_ready] : CarrySkip wrapping CPoCProbeResponse(outcome=ready) for H_i
   → every V records ready_at[H_i] = (N_ready, h_ready)

2. Nonces N_ready+1 … N_ready+W_fair·N_slots advance:
   V tallies n_inf(H_i), n_probe(H_i) at H_i-slot nonces from Diff

3. Violation predicate fires at V:
   V enters "withholding-alert" state for (D, H_i)

4. Downstream enforcement: every V that is itself a future executor for D
   refuses to serve D's requests (returns a new p2p signal
   `RouteFairnessRefusal(D, H_i, evidence_refs)`) until:
     (a) D issues MsgStartInference(executor = H_i) AND H_i confirms it (MsgConfirmStart),
     OR
     (b) H_i re-enters cPoC (signals active/prepare via a fresh CPoCProbeResponse
         or via Schedule(H_i, H) transitioning back to {active, prepare}).

5. When (a) or (b) holds, V clears the withholding-alert and resumes serving D.
```

**Expected verdict:** `**Invalid` against the developer**, not against any host. Evidence: `ready_at[H_i]` receipt + the `H_i`-slot window of `Diff` showing probes / empty slots but no inference requests.

**Why enforcement sits with "next hosts".** The only actor that can credibly deny D further service is the host queued to execute D's next request. If those hosts refuse until D resumes fair routing, D has a direct economic incentive to stop withholding. No mainnet round-trip is required in the hot path; the decision is local at each `V` from the same `Diff` contents, so every honest host reaches the same alert.

**Open parameters (deferred to Open questions):**

- `W_fair`, `θ_fair`, `θ_min_inf` thresholds.
- Whether a `ready_at` receipt decays after the host re-enters cPoC (presumably yes — once `Schedule(H_i, H) = active` again, old receipts are cleared).
- Precise wire format of `RouteFairnessRefusal` and whether it also lands in `Diff` as evidence for slashing D's stake.

### C14 — Low-load strategic delay (developer heartbeat mitigation)

**Applicability:** Only possible on **low session load** — specifically, when `Diff` contains **no signed entries between `R_req` and `N_carry`** that would otherwise tighten V's upper bound `h_high` on `R_req`'s true height. On any session with concurrent inference traffic, intermediate entries auto-tighten the band and this attack surface closes by itself.

**Setup.** `Schedule(H_i, h_req) = idle` (host is not on cPoC at the moment `R_req` enters `Diff`). Immediately after `R_req`, session traffic goes quiet: `D` has no other inferences to submit. A malicious `H_i` then waits strategically for its next scheduled cPoC window to open at some height `h > h_req`, signs `CPoCSkipResponse(R_req, active)` during that later window, and relies on `D`'s late `CarrySkip` landing far enough in the future that V's height interval `I = [h_X, h_carry]` contains `h`. Under `∃ H ∈ I` semantics (Verdict predicate, step 3) the carried refusal now passes, even though the host was **idle at `h_req`** and therefore owed the developer real inference.

**Flow (attack, without mitigation):**

```
mainnet h_req  : Diff[R_req]    = MsgStartInference        # H_i idle at h_req
... quiet session; no intermediate Diff entries ...
mainnet h+Δ    : H_i enters cPoC at mainnet height h > h_req
                 H_i → D : CPoCSkipResponse(R_req, active) # signed at height h (fresh lie)
mainnet h_carry: Diff[N_carry]  = CarrySkip(embeds above)
V on ingest:     h_X ≈ h_req;   h_carry ≫ h_req
                 I = [h_X, h_carry]  —  wide band, no intermediate stamp
                 ∃ H ∈ I : Schedule(H_i, H) = active  ⇒  step 3 passes → Valid (wrong)
```

**Mitigation (developer heartbeat).** When `D` has an outstanding `R_req` and **no further inference to submit within the current round** (`R_req … R_req + N_slots`), `D` SHOULD emit a lightweight **heartbeat** — a `MsgSkipProbe` targeted at the natural next slot `executor(R_req + 1)` — within ≈ 1 mainnet block of `R_req`. The heartbeat carries `D`'s signed `observed_height ≈ h_req`, and the host's responding `CPoCProbeResponse` (carried back via a subsequent `CarrySkip`) carries the host's signed `observed_height` as well. Both stamps land in `Diff` at nonces `> R_req`, providing a tight upper bound `h_high` on `R_req`'s true height.

> **Ownership moved.** The heartbeat is **no longer specified here and is no longer optional.** [HEIGHT_SYNC_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md](./HEIGHT_SYNC_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md) **§10** makes it a **required** height-sync primitive with its own cadence in mainnet blocks (`K_hb`), its own message pair (`MsgHeartbeat` / `MsgHeightAck`), and an enforcement path that does not depend on `D`'s goodwill: a user that stops heartbeating causes every host to arm **close-ready** and the escrow to be closed through finalization `USER_TIMEOUT` (height-sync §12). cPoC is a **consumer** of that mechanism, not its owner. Consequences for this section:
>
> - Where cPoC is deployed, a `MsgSkipProbe` carrying `observed_height` **also satisfies** the height-sync heartbeat obligation for its target slot, so there is one mechanism at every deployment level, not two (height-sync §10.2).
> - The band-tightening described below still holds verbatim; what changes is that `h_high` is now available from **mandatory** stamps rather than from a heartbeat `D` may have skipped. The "careless `D` exposes itself" degradation below therefore applies only to the *interval width*, not to whether stamps exist at all.
> - `observed_height` is **required** on the heartbeat pair and **recommended** on `MsgStartInference` / `MsgConfirmStart` (height-sync §10.5), which is the structural answer to Open question **11(iv)**.

**Cadence — one heartbeat, one round, only while idle.**

- **One-shot per quiet window.** `D` emits the heartbeat **once** within the round of `R_req`. A single stamped entry is sufficient to tighten `h_high`; additional heartbeats add no verdict strength.
- **Scoped to the round of `R_req`.** Once the session advances past nonce `R_req + N_slots` (one full executor round), the band for `R_req` is already bounded from above by *any* signed entry in that window. `D` MUST NOT continue emitting heartbeats after the round closes — further ones no longer improve the verdict for `R_req`.
- **Conditional on absence of real traffic.** Heartbeats are only needed when `D` would otherwise leave `Diff` quiet. If `D` has real `MsgStartInference` traffic queued (any nonce in `[R_req + 1, R_req + N_slots]`), those entries already provide `h_high` via their own `observed_height` stamps — no heartbeat is emitted.

**Flow (mitigated):**

```
mainnet h_req    : Diff[R_req]       = MsgStartInference(to H_i)       # real request
mainnet h_req+ε  : Diff[R_req+1]     = MsgSkipProbe(to H_{i+1})         # heartbeat — if no real follow-up
mainnet h_req+ε' : H_{i+1} → D : CPoCProbeResponse(N_SP=R_req+1, …)
mainnet h_req+ε" : Diff[N_hb_carry]  = CarrySkip(embeds the probe response)
                                                                        # observed_height stamps ≈ h_req
... (D stops heartbeating; round closes) ...
mainnet h_carry  : Diff[N_carry]     = CarrySkip(for the real R_req)

V on ingest of Diff[N_carry]:
  h_X    = height_at[X]                           (≈ h_req; lower bound)
  h_high = observed_height on earliest stamp in  (≈ h_req+ε; heartbeat tightened)
           Diff[(R_req, N_carry)]
  band   = [h_X, h_high]  —  collapses to ≈ {h_req}
  step 3 now evaluates against a near-point band:
    Schedule(H_i, h_req) = idle  ⇒  Invalid (attack closed)
```

**Interaction with other cases.**

- If the heartbeat is targeted at `H_i` itself and `H_i` responds `ready`, the response contradicts its own later `CPoCSkipResponse(R_req, active)` — a **double-claim** analogous to the `MsgConfirmStart` vs. `CPoCSkipResponse` mutual-exclusion rule. Verdict is `Invalid` against `H_i` on sight, without needing the band to resolve.
- If the heartbeat is targeted at the next-slot host `H_{i+1}` (the natural case since `R_req + 1`'s executor is `H_{i+1}`), C13's withholding detector MUST exempt heartbeat probes emitted while an `R_req` awaits verdict — the probe is height-sync machinery, not a sustained routing pattern. See Open questions.
- If `D` fails to emit a heartbeat despite having no alternative traffic, the band stays wide and the fresh-lie attack succeeds under `∃ H ∈ I`. The heartbeat is therefore a **developer-side obligation**, not a protocol-enforced one from the host's perspective; a careless or lazy `D` exposes itself to being lied to. This aligns incentives: heartbeating protects `D`'s own payment for real work.

**Expected verdict:** With the heartbeat in place, the same `CPoCSkipResponse` that would have strategically passed under a wide band now fails step 3 and is settled `Invalid` via the standard `CPoCVote` quorum (§ Consensus / voting). Without the heartbeat on a low-load session, the protocol's verdict fidelity degrades gracefully — the verdict is whatever `∃ H ∈ I` returns on the wide band — and settlement-layer penalties on host withholding remain the only recourse.

**Open parameters (deferred to Open questions):**

- The exact spacing between `R_req` and the heartbeat (≈ 1 mainnet block is a suggestion; could be tighter or looser).
- Whether the heartbeat must be a `MsgSkipProbe` or a dedicated lightweight message without a response expectation. `MsgSkipProbe` is reused here because it already carries an `observed_height` and rides existing Diff wire formats, but a response-free variant is cheaper.
- The exemption rule carving heartbeats out of C13's withholding tally.

## Consensus / voting

Every verifier `V` computes the **Verdict predicate** (§ Data flow) independently against its local view of `Diff` and `H(V)`. When `Verdict ∈ {Invalid, Inconclusive-pending-confirmation}` (or a C13 developer-withholding alert fires), `V` signs and emits a **`CPoCVote`** for that `N_carry`. For **`target = host(H_i)`**, votes are addressed to `D` as collector (this release). For **`target` naming `D`** (C3′, C13), trusted aggregation is **not** specified here — see § Consensus / voting (optimistic gap until self-finalization). A verdict is **settled** for finalization only after a **quorum** of independent votes has been collected; an individual verifier's opinion, by itself, slashes nobody.

### `CPoCVote` (new p2p message, then into finalization bundle)

| Field | Meaning |
| ----- | ------- |
| `N_carry` | Nonce of the `CarrySkip` this vote refers to (or, for C13, the earliest `Diff` reference in the evidence window). |
| `referenced_nonce` | `R_req` or `N_SP`, copied from the carry; lets the collector filter duplicates. |
| `target` | Kind-and-identity of the actor being voted against: `host(H_i)` for C2/C4/C6, `carrier(D)` for C3', `developer(D)` for C13. |
| `verdict` | `Invalid` (most common). `Valid` votes are implicit — honest verifiers simply don't emit a vote — so no `Valid` voting channel is required. |
| `reason_code` | Machine-readable pointer to which predicate step failed (`schedule_fail`, `role_fail`, `causality_fail`, `double_claim_confirm_then_skip`, `double_claim_skip_then_confirm`, `withholding`, `height_confirmed_invalid`, …). |
| `schedule_witness` | `(H*, Schedule(H_i, H*))` for the height in `I` the verifier consulted, so the bundle is self-contained for slashing. |
| `signature` | Host signature under domain `cPoCVoteContent` (binds all fields above). |

A single `CPoCVote` is cheap; the flood size is bounded because only verifiers with a non-`Valid` local verdict emit one, and every one is a pointer into existing `Diff` entries.

### Collector: this release vs. self-finalization (including votes against `D`)

**Host-fault cases (`target = host(H_i)` — C2, C2′, C4, C6, etc.).** The **developer** `D` is the vote collector for this release:

- `D` already owns the `CarrySkip` envelope and knows which `N_carry` the vote refers to.
- `D` is the economically interested party when a malicious host means `D` did not get served.

Collection procedure:

1. Each `V` with a non-`Valid` verdict sends `CPoCVote` to `D` via p2p (optionally piggy-backed on the same channel that carries `SkipEvidenceGossip`).
2. `D` aggregates distinct signatures until `|votes(Invalid)| ≥ quorum_invalid`.
3. `D` attaches the bundle to finalization per [FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md](./FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md). The vote bundle is the input to slashing.

**Developer-target cases (`target` names `D` — C3′ forged carry, C13 withholding).** `D` cannot be the trusted aggregator of votes that would slash or dispute `D`. **Normative intent:** once **self-finalization** is implemented, **`CPoCVote`s for these targets MUST be collected and aggregated in the finalization round** (the same developer-independent path as other settlement), not by `D`.

**This release — optimistic gap.** The protocol **does not** specify a collector for developer-target votes. We **assume `D` behaves honestly** when forwarding or aggregating evidence in practice, or that C3′/C13 `Invalid` outcomes are out-of-band rare; **malicious `D` censoring or withholding `CPoCVote`s against itself is a known uncovered negative case**, scheduled for closure when self-finalization lands. Verifiers still emit `CPoCVote` with `target = developer(D)` / `carrier(D)` as specified; only the **trusted aggregation path** is deferred.

**Future release (self-finalization).** When the finalization round aggregates `CPoCVote` without relying on `D`:

- Each `V` still emits `CPoCVote` on the standard channel; wire format unchanged.
- The finalization round collects votes at a deterministic boundary for **both** host-fault and developer-fault cases, removing reliance on `D` for any target.
- This also removes the failure mode "`D` stops sending traffic and never submits a vote bundle" for host-fault cases.

### Quorum, weighting, tie-breaks

Exact values — `quorum_invalid` (e.g. simple-majority vs. 2/3 stake-weighted), tie-break rules, stake weighting, and the mapping from votes to mainnet slashing amounts — must match the finalization / slashing layer. These are **chain-parametrized** and **deferred** to [FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md](./FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md) and the mainnet slashing spec. This doc only guarantees:

- Every honest `V` reaches the **same** verdict from the **same** `Diff` + strictly-confirmed height slice (by construction of the Verdict predicate).
- Dishonest minority votes cannot flip a correct quorum, because `CPoCVote` includes the `schedule_witness` and is auditable at finalization time (a dishonest vote is itself slashable).

## Open questions (for formalization)

1. `**PoC_slot_set` provenance:** set at escrow init (immutable) vs queried post-init and cached. Different failure modes.
2. `**prepare` policy:** is skip allowed while `Schedule = prepare` (treat like `active`) or forbidden (treat like `idle`)? Chain-spec flag `skip_allowed_during_prepare`.
3. **Signing input** domain separators: `cPoCRefusalContent` (host signature on `CPoCSkipResponse`, binds `inference_id` + `reference_nonce` + reason), `cPoCProbeResponseContent` (host signature on `CPoCProbeResponse`, binds `probe_nonce` + `reference_nonce` + outcome), `CarrySkipContent` (developer signature on `CarrySkip`, binds `N_carry` + `referenced_nonce` + `payload_kind` + `host_response` bytes), and the signing input for `MsgSkipProbe` (binds `probe_nonce = N_SP` + `target_host_id`).
4. **Evidence-object layout** for finalization (list of `Diff`-refs, signatures, schedule-witness); shared with [FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md](./FINALIZATION_COLLECTOR_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md).
5. **C13 thresholds `(W_fair, θ_fair, θ_min_inf)`** for the developer-withholding predicate: how many `H_i`-slot nonces of probes / empty slots vs. real inferences, over how many rounds, qualify as misbehavior? Must be tuned so that legitimate brief probing (e.g. a single confirmation probe right after `ready` before resuming inference) does not trigger alerts.
6. `**ready_at` lifecycle.** When exactly does a `ready` receipt for `H_i` expire? Candidates: (a) on the first strictly-confirmed `Schedule(H_i, H) ∈ {active, prepare}` after the receipt; (b) on any subsequent non-`ready` `CPoCProbeResponse` / `CPoCSkipResponse` for `H_i` carried in `Diff`; (c) a hard TTL in mainnet heights. Likely all three with `(a) ∨ (b) ∨ (c)`.
7. `**RouteFairnessRefusal` surface.** Is this purely a p2p refusal signal between hosts, or must it also land in `Diff` as a signed artefact so mainnet can slash `D`? If the latter, it becomes another `SubnetTx` variant and needs its own signing domain.
8. **Roundtrip-free Path B via developer unilateral skip (future release).** Can the `MsgSkipProbe` → p2p response → `CarrySkip` roundtrip be eliminated by letting `D` place a D-signed **unilateral-skip marker** (e.g. `MsgCPoCSkipMarker(nonce, target_host = H_i, basis = {N_prev_carry, h_prev})`) at `H_i`'s slot nonce and routing the real `MsgStartInference` to the next slot? Requires (i) wire format for the marker and its signing domain; (ii) a freshness rule keyed to a prior `CarrySkip` for `H_i` — the marker is valid only while the schedule-implied cPoC window referenced by `N_prev_carry` has not expired at V's current height; (iii) a per-evidence cap on consecutive unilateral skips so a single old `CarrySkip` can't authorize indefinite skipping; (iv) reconciling with `ready_at[H_i]` and the C13 detector — a `ready` receipt invalidates outstanding marker authority immediately. Explicitly **out of scope for the current release.**
9. **Vote quorum parameters.** `quorum_invalid` (simple majority vs. 2/3 stake-weighted), whether votes are counted per-host or stake-weighted, tie-break rules, and a liveness timeout for the collector to declare "no quorum reached, treat as `Valid`" are chain-parametrized and deferred to the finalization / slashing spec.
10. **Self-finalization collector (future release) — required for developer-target votes.** When the finalization round aggregates `CPoCVote` without relying on `D`, we need: (i) a deterministic boundary condition that triggers vote aggregation (block height, session sealing, etc.); (ii) **explicit ingestion of `CPoCVote` with `target = developer(D)` / `carrier(D)`** (C3′, C13) so aggregation is not left to `D`; (iii) handling for late-arriving votes across the boundary; (iv) a migration story so older nodes that still send host-fault votes to `D` compose with the new collector. The wire format of `CPoCVote` itself should not need to change — only the aggregation destination. This closes the **optimistic gap** documented in § Consensus / voting (malicious `D` censoring votes against itself). Explicitly **out of scope for the current release**.
11. **C14 heartbeat policy.** **Largely resolved by [HEIGHT_SYNC_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md](./HEIGHT_SYNC_PROTOCOL_PROPOSAL.md) §10–§12**, which owns the heartbeat. (i) Spacing: superseded by the height cadence `K_hb` (default 4 mainnet blocks) plus the ack deadline `D_ack` (default 2) — height-sync §10.3, §20. (ii) **Resolved:** a dedicated pair exists (`MsgHeartbeat` / `MsgHeightAck`), and `MsgSkipProbe` remains an accepted carrier where cPoC is deployed — height-sync §10.2. (iii) **Still open here:** the carve-out rule in C13's withholding tally for probes emitted while an `R_req` awaits verdict. Note that with a dedicated `MsgHeartbeat`, a height-sync heartbeat is *distinguishable by message type* from a cPoC probe, so the carve-out can key on the type instead of on intent. (iv) **Resolved as structural:** `observed_height` is REQUIRED on the heartbeat pair and RECOMMENDED on `MsgStartInference` / `MsgConfirmStart` / `MsgFinishInference` — height-sync §10.5. Remaining decision for this doc: whether cPoC additionally *requires* the stamps on `MsgSkipProbe` / `CarrySkip` for its own verdict determinism, given that `(C-turn)` (height-sync §17) already makes the interval endpoints agree across verifiers.
12. **C2' seal window `W_seal`.** Default proposed at ≈ 2 mainnet blocks (matching `timeout_skip_gossip`). Needs to be tuned against (i) realistic `MsgConfirmStart` arrival latency after a `CarrySkip`, (ii) how long verifiers can reasonably buffer `pending_verdicts` entries in the `provisional` state, (iii) whether settlement-layer slashing for post-seal confirm-then-skip contradictions is strong enough to treat the seal closure as a true bound. If not, consider extending `W_seal` or allowing a bounded number of post-seal flips recorded as "late evidence" rather than verdict changes.
13. **Devshard-ingest mutual-exclusion rule (C2' defence in depth).** Whether the gateway-level rejection of `MsgConfirmStart` when `CarrySkip(payload_kind = skip_response)` for the same `inference_id` already exists in `Diff` (and vice versa) is a **MUST** or a **SHOULD**. MUST simplifies verdict reasoning (step 2 scan becomes a residual safety net for the race window only) but creates a harder dependency on every ingest pipeline behaving identically; SHOULD keeps the predicate as the sole source of truth but leaves the ingest rule as an opportunistic optimization. Tie-break also affects how implementations handle a genuine race in which both messages are valid at their own arrival times.
