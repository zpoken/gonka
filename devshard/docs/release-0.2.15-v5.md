# Release guide: `devshard-0.2.15-v5`

Operator-facing contract for the v5 deployment line. Alongside the ingress
and updater changes below, v5 adds **warm cutover**: a same-name SHA swap
waits for the new child's recovery backlog and background repairs to finish
before replacing a healthy generation.

## What changes for an operator

- **Public ingress is HAProxy.** `proxy` is now `proxy-router`, a host-local
  HAProxy that balances two private nginx policy workers (`proxy-policy`,
  `proxy-policy2`). nginx keeps TLS, CORS, rate limits and route policy;
  HAProxy owns connection distribution and the versiond pool. Ports, TLS
  settings and `config.env` keys of the old proxy are unchanged.
- **versiond-router is an HAProxy fleet.** Three router slots run as separate
  Compose projects managed by `versiond-router-fleet.sh`. They discover
  versiond hosts through DNS or an explicit endpoint file, check
  `GET /readyz?version=<v>` on every host, and learn protocol names from the
  governance `/versions` feed. A new approved version needs no host-side edit.
- **versiond keeps at most one draining predecessor per version.** A second
  same-name SHA change that arrives while the previous generation is still
  draining is deferred and retried, so rapid catalog updates cannot stack
  generations and exhaust the shared PostgreSQL connections (#1702).
- **versiond has graceful shutdown and `/readyz`.** Both the single-versiond
  stack and the HA overlay use a Compose healthcheck on `/readyz`, so
  `docker compose up --wait` returns only when versiond can serve.
- **Local HA PostgreSQL is persistent.** `devshard-postgres` keeps `PGDATA` in
  `DEVSHARD_POSTGRES_DATA_DIR` (default `./devshards/postgres`). On the first
  v5 start its entrypoint copies the v4 anonymous volume there and leaves the
  volume untouched as the rollback copy.
- **versiond can run on other machines.** See
  [Multi-host versiond](#multi-host-versiond).

Removed with the old model:

| Removed | Replacement |
| --- | --- |
| nginx `versiond-router` singleton service | router fleet (`versiond-router-fleet.sh`) |
| `VERSIOND_HOSTS` | DNS alias `VERSIOND_POOL_HOST` or `VERSIOND_POOL_ENDPOINTS_FILE`; the old value is still accepted |
| `VERSIOND_ADMIN_LISTEN_ADDR` | `GET :8080/readyz` on the traffic listener |

## Recovery and readiness

v5 keeps shared Postgres, sticky escrow routing, validation-lease
exclusivity and the gRPC chain transport. In addition to the ingress and
router-fleet changes above, it changes the **recovery / readiness contract**:

- `devshardd` `/ready` is split into a **status code** (can this process serve:
  chain up, storage open, not draining) and a **body field** `recovery_complete`
  (is this process warm: backlog drained **and** background sealed-index /
  validation-obs repairs finished). Status is `200` within seconds of boot, so
  a solo restart is no longer force-stopped by the 60s `VERSIOND_READY_TIMEOUT`
  before it ever serves. The body field is the warm signal only a version
  replacement with a healthy old generation needs to wait on.
- `versiond`'s overlap swap waits for `recovery_complete: true` before
  publishing the new child. Solo start and the stop/start branch publish on
  status code alone — waiting with no warm generation to fall back on would
  just be an outage.
- The sealed-inference index rebuild no longer wipes and reinserts every
  sealed row on every restart. Snapshot restore does a gap fill (one id scan,
  zero writes when the index is already there); full journal replay rebuilds
  from the diff journal in batched transactions off the publish path.

---

## What's in this release

| Area | Change |
| --- | --- |
| **Ready probe split** | `/ready` status 200 = can serve; body `recovery_complete` = warm (backlog drained **and** `WaitRecoveryRepairs` returned). Counters `sessions_total`/`sessions_recovered`/`sessions_failed`/`sessions_version_skipped`/`sessions_pending` promoted from log-only to body + Prometheus |
| **Warm cutover** | Overlap swap waits for `recovery_complete: true` on the new child's `/ready` body before the route swap (`VERSIOND_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT`, default 30m). Solo start and stop/start publish on status 200. Bail-outs: absent field → cold cutover; old-child death → publish immediately; hostDraining/ctx → abort; timeout → old keeps serving |
| **Sealed-inference index** | Snapshot restore: gap fill only, no wipe (O(sealed) writes → 0). Full replay: rebuild from diff journal in batched transactions off the publish path. `WaitObsRepairs` → `WaitRecoveryRepairs` (waits both validation-obs and sealed-index repair) |
| **Nonce eviction** | A live session that fails `types.ErrInvalidNonce` is evicted and re-recovered (reuses `resolutionFailures` negative-cache so a bad client cannot spin the reload). Required for warm cutover: a long warm-up leaves the new child behind the old generation's writes |
| **versiond** | `getChildRecoveryStatus` reads the `/ready` body; `getHTTPStatus` stays status-only so `watchChildReadiness` never gates on the body (pinned by test) |

---

## Breaking / operator-facing changes

### `/ready` status vs body

The single probe that used to answer both "can serve" and "is recovery done"
is split:

| Signal | Meaning | Who reads it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Status code 200 | Chain up, storage open, not draining | `waitForChildServingReady`, `watchChildReadiness`, K8s readinessProbe |
| Body `recovery_complete: true` | Recovery backlog drained **and** `WaitRecoveryRepairs` returned | `waitForChildRecoveryComplete` (overlap swap only) |

A pre-v5 `devshardd` does not ship `recovery_complete` on its `/ready` body.
The new `versiond` detects the absent field and skips the wait, cutting over
cold (flow B semantics) — so a mixed-version estate (new `versiond` + old
`devshardd`) keeps the v4 cold-cutover behaviour rather than hanging.

### Rolling updates (same name, new sha256) — warm before traffic, overlap only

The v4 rule was "new ready before traffic". The v5 rule is "new **warm** before
traffic, overlap only":

| Storage mode (both old + new `--print-storage-mode`) | Swap behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Exactly `postgres` | Blue/green: start new child on a new port → wait admin `/ready` 200 + public `/healthz` 2xx → **wait `recovery_complete: true`** → route new traffic to new generation → drain old → SIGTERM |
| `sqlite`, `hybrid`, `auto`/unknown, legacy binary without the flag | Exclusive stop/start (no overlapping children, no warm wait) |

Operator knobs (all defaulted; see [rolling-update.md](./rolling-update.md)):

| Env | Default | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VERSIOND_READY_TIMEOUT` | `60s` | Abort swap if incoming child never becomes *able to serve* (old keeps serving) |
| `VERSIOND_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT` | `30m` | Abort overlap swap if the new child's `recovery_complete` does not flip true in time (old keeps serving). **Not** the 60s ready timeout — recovery of a long journal is minutes to hours |
| `VERSIOND_DRAIN_TIMEOUT` | `15m` | Max wait for old proxy leases + lifecycle inflight |
| `VERSIOND_DRAIN_KILL_GRACE` | `10m` | Legacy no-status cushion / process kill backstop |
| `DEVSHARD_SHUTDOWN_GRACE` | `10m` | `devshardd` graceful HTTP shutdown after SIGTERM |

Bail-outs from the warm wait (companion *ready-on-boot-warm-cutover* flow D),
all of which cut over or abort rather than hang:

| Condition | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `recovery_complete` absent from the body | Skip the wait, cut over cold (flow B; an un-updated child cannot know about the field) |
| Old child stops being `Running` | Abandon the wait and publish immediately — a warming child plus a dead old child is an outage |
| `hostDraining` or ctx done | Abort, stop the new child |
| `VERSIOND_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT` elapsed | Abort, old keeps serving, retry next reconcile |

### Sealed-inference index rebuild

`RebuildSealedInferenceIndex` no longer runs unconditionally on every session
recovery. It is split by recovery path:

| Path | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Snapshot restored (`replayFrom > 1`) | `FillSealedInferenceIndexGaps` inline: one `SealedInferenceIDs` scan, insert bare rows only for ids with no stored row. Never deletes, never downgrades an `ObsPresent = true` row. Normally writes nothing. |
| Full replay (`replayFrom == 1`) | `RebuildSealedInferenceIndexFromDiffs` in the background behind `ObsRepairGate`: wipe, then insert rich rows built from the diff journal in batched transactions. |

Net effect on the incident node (~1.5M sealed inferences): snapshot restart
goes from ~1.5M writes to **zero writes** (~0.3–0.6s of reads). Full replay
goes from ~25 min to ~11–17 s, off the publish path.

### Nonce eviction

Required on the same change as the warm wait: a child that recovered early
during a long warm-up sits behind the old generation's writes to the shared
store. The first request then fails `types.ErrInvalidNonce`. The new path
drops the stale session from `HostManager.sessions`, `Close`s the host, deletes
escrow metrics, and re-runs `recoverStoredSession` through the same
singleflight as `getOrCreate`. A bogus nonce is negative-cached via
`resolutionFailures` so a bad client cannot spin the reload; a genuine
catch-up mismatch uses a short TTL, not `permanentFailureTTL`.

---

## Binary upgrade compatibility

A same-name binary update publishes a new SHA through governance. The warm
wait bail-outs handle mixed `versiond` and `devshardd` releases:

- **New `versiond` + new `devshardd`**: full v5 behaviour — overlap swap waits
  for `recovery_complete`.
- **New `versiond` + old `devshardd`**: the old child's `/ready` body has no
  `recovery_complete`; the new `versiond` skips the wait and cuts over cold
  (v4 behaviour). No outage, no hang.
- **Old `versiond` + new `devshardd`**: the old `versiond` does not read the
  body; it publishes on status 200 (v4 behaviour). The new `devshardd`'s
  `recovery_complete` field is simply ignored. No outage.

So v5 can roll out incrementally without coordinating a simultaneous
`versiond` + `devshardd` upgrade.

---

## Updating an existing host

The update is a fixed sequence of `docker compose` commands.
`deploy/join/update-devshard.sh` runs them in the right order and prints each
one. Requirements: Docker Compose 2.24.4 or newer, Python 3, `jq`, `timeout`,
`flock`, and `sha256sum`.

From the checkout that runs the node:

```bash
git fetch origin
git checkout <release branch or tag>
cd deploy/join
source ./config.env
./update-devshard.sh --check
./update-devshard.sh
```

`--check` detects the topology, renders the Compose model, verifies that the local
HA replicas share one PostgreSQL, checks its connection budget and migration
space, and prints the images that will run. It does not replace services, but
it writes database probes, including a challenge through each running HA
process. `--dry-run` runs the same preflight and prints the replacement commands.

Compose files are taken from `COMPOSE_FILE` when it is set, otherwise from the
labels of the running `versiond` container (so operator overlays such as
observability files stay in the model), otherwise the stock files are used.
The topology is HA when the `versiond` service declares `GONKA_HA=true`,
which the HA overlay sets on every replica (the same declaration versiond
passes to its children and the routers turn into the `Devshard-Ha` header); a
single-versiond host stays single. The script handles every local `versiond`, `versiond2`, `versiond3`, …
service it finds in the model and never adds a replica by itself; services
whose replica count is `0` are skipped.

What the script runs, in order:

| Step | Single | HA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker compose pull` of the devshard services | yes | yes |
| `up -d --no-deps --wait devshard-postgres` (entrypoint migrates v4 data) | | local PostgreSQL only |
| `versiond-router-fleet.sh prepare-networks` and `apply` | | yes |
| `up -d --no-deps --wait proxy-policy2`, then `proxy-policy`, then `proxy`; in HA the fleet's `verify-admission` then proves the new public proxy admits every router slot and live route before anything else changes | yes | yes |
| `docker rm -f versiond-router` (the old nginx singleton) | | if present |
| `up -d --no-deps --wait` of each replica, `VERSIOND_LEGACY_HOST` last (default `versiond`) | `versiond` only | yes |

The public proxy starts before the policy workers because they need its
network alias; its health is checked after the workers start. These services
form one replacement step. Other services use `up --wait` individually.

### What happens on failure

The script holds the deployment lock for the whole run (the same lock as
`versiond-router-fleet.sh`), so a second operator or a manual fleet command
cannot interleave with it. The default lock identifies the Docker daemon and
Compose project, independently of the path to `config.env` or the checkout.
`--check` and `--dry-run` take this lock too because they write challenges.

Before the first change it renders the model, checks that every replica names
the same PostgreSQL, opens that PostgreSQL with the configured credentials
from a helper container and requires a writable primary, and checks that the
v4 cluster copy fits. A wrong `DEVSHARD_POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, a read-only
replica or an unreachable managed host therefore stops the run while the
previous release is still fully serving.

It also checks that the model points at the database the running replicas
already use. Every running local replica reports its storage lineage through
`/internal/storage-identity`; they must agree, and the database the model
names must carry the same lineage. Because a physical copy keeps the
lineage, every running HA process writes a random challenge through its own
PostgreSQL pool and the model's database must show each value: a clone would not.
A `PGHOST` that now points at another working database, or at a copy, is
refused, because a rolling replacement would otherwise leave old replicas
writing to one history and new replicas to another. Set
`UPDATE_ACCEPT_DATABASE_CHANGE=true` only for an intended migration to a
restored copy. The updater refuses this override while a local writer runs,
and refuses it with explicit pool membership because it cannot check whether
remote writers have stopped.

During the first v4-to-v5 update, legacy replicas cannot provide this proof.
The updater permits their bundled PostgreSQL migration only when their existing
`PGHOST` and `PGDATABASE` match that cluster. An external database cannot be
verified this way: stop every writer and explicitly acknowledge the intended
database change before updating.

The supported v4-to-v5 upgrade starts with all versiond replicas on one host.
Multi-host versiond is introduced in v5; configure it after updating the
network node, following [Multi-host versiond](#multi-host-versiond).

These checks cover only the versiond replicas that the updater manages on
this host. On other hosts, run the updater's separate `--check-storage` mode
before admitting replicas to the pool; see [Multi-host versiond](#multi-host-versiond).
All replicas must connect to the same PostgreSQL database.

The host updater supports the bundled PostgreSQL and an external writable
PostgreSQL endpoint reachable from the deployment network without custom TLS
configuration. PostgreSQL TLS deployment and certificate management are outside
this updater's scope. It rejects explicitly configured `PGSSL*` options,
except `PGSSLMODE=disable`; leave them unset for the stock deployment. This
restriction applies to host updates, not the separate `--check-storage` command
whose reference connection uses a local PostgreSQL client.

The write probe opens PostgreSQL with the model's credentials from a temporary
helper container. It creates and drops a temporary table, so a read-only
primary, revoked write rights or a full disk stop the run.
A bundled PostgreSQL that exists but is stopped is not a fresh install:
start it first. `UPDATE_SKIP_POSTGRES_PROBE=true` skips database probes, but
still validates supported connection settings. It is meant for a host that
cannot reach the database at all.

Before replacing public ingress or a versiond container, the updater saves its
Docker configuration: image ID, command, environment, healthcheck, volume
sources, published ports, and networks. If replacement or public admission
fails, it restores that configuration and stops. Public proxy and policy
workers are restored together, including the old nginx during the first v5
cutover; the legacy router is removed only after public admission succeeds.
Services updated in earlier steps remain on their new versions.

Records are stored under `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/gonka/updater/`,
in a directory identified by the Docker daemon and Compose project. Set
`UPDATE_STATE_DIR` to use another persistent directory; all invocations for
this deployment must use the same directory. Records include the container's
environment, so keep this directory private. The previous image is pinned as
`gonka-previous/<deployment-key>/<service>`. A successful no-op rerun does not
overwrite the previous configuration or image. Mutable image tags are refreshed
when the registry is available; retry can use cached images if every required
image is already present. Saved image IDs make rollback independent of a tag
moving since the container was started.

A pending replacement is recorded before Compose changes a service. If the
updater is killed, the next normal run restores that pending step before
starting preflight and retrying. Recovered PostgreSQL retains the original
Compose paths for discovery, so another retry does not depend on a deleted
temporary recovery file or require setting `COMPOSE_FILE`.
`--check` and `--dry-run` report pending
recovery and stop. If restoration fails, the records remain for another retry;
inspect the reported service's logs and fix the cause before rerunning.

The saved specification preserves mount sources, including anonymous volumes.
It does not copy application data or preserve the contents of files edited in
place on the host. Keep the previous release's files available when changing
mounted configuration. PostgreSQL rollback restores only the image and keeps
the current migration target; automatically switching back to the old data
directory could discard writes made since migration.

Before replacing bundled PostgreSQL, the updater rejects changes to its data
mount or `PGDATA` during an ordinary update. The first v4-to-v5 copy is allowed
only into an unpublished target. It writes a fresh control value to
`public.gonka_updater_continuity`, then durably records that value, the candidate
image, the migration target and the retained v4 volume. After startup it checks
that the value survived before completing the step. A mismatch stops PostgreSQL
and leaves recovery pending. A retry uses the saved target before reading the
new deployment configuration; it never switches back to a pre-migration copy.
The control table contains one row and does not change inference records.

For each HA versiond replacement, the updater preserves the currently served
HA route set. It requires another admitted member for those routes before
stopping the old instance, then checks the candidate's per-version readiness
and admission in every router before completing the step. A candidate that is
healthy overall but cannot serve a required version is restored before the
next replica is stopped. Pinned versions are checked on their designated owner
before its replacement is confirmed; they have no second-owner reserve.

Two things the script does not undo. The v4 PostgreSQL volume copy is safe
to repeat but never reversed automatically (see [Rolling back](#rolling-back)).
And a router fleet update runs inside `versiond-router-fleet.sh apply`, which
restores a slot's previous image itself when its replacement does not pass
admission, and refuses to start while a bootstrap version has no ready
router at all (a PostgreSQL or versiond outage), so an outage cannot be
rolled over silently.

A fresh bundled PostgreSQL records `.gonka-init-complete` inside `PGDATA`
through an initdb hook, and a migrated cluster records `.migrated-from-v4`
next to it before the copy is published; a persistent cluster without either
marker, or whose `pg_controldata` system identifier differs from an attached
v4 volume, is refused rather than started on the wrong history. The migration
marker also records a fingerprint of the source control file and WAL at copy
time. Any subsequent change to the retained source is refused, regardless of
which copy has the greater checkpoint LSN. Do not restart that old volume as a
writer. Old experimental markers without this fingerprint require manual
history verification; do not create a replacement marker to bypass the check.

`--check` and `--dry-run` change no service. They do run the PostgreSQL
probe from a helper container (which may pull the pinned PostgreSQL image)
and the migration space probe (which may create the empty target directory).
The storage challenge remains in `devshard_storage_identity.challenge` until
the next check overwrites it; it does not modify inference records.

Maintenance notes for an HA host:

- Replacing the single public proxy can close existing connections, both on
  the first nginx-to-HAProxy cutover and on subsequent image/config changes.
  Schedule these replacements in a maintenance window; uninterrupted streams
  across a public-listener replacement are not guaranteed.
  Restarting the shared local PostgreSQL interrupts devshard work on all
  replicas. Schedule the run outside PoC/cPoC and update one host at a time.
- The HAProxy routers start before versiond is replaced. They accept a
  pre-v5 versiond through its `/<version>/healthz` route checks, so the
  versiond replacements afterwards happen behind active checks.
- Budget up to 35 minutes for a slow versiond reconcile; healthy hosts finish
  much earlier.

### Rolling back

Rolling back is choosing the previous images and running the same sequence:

```bash
export VERSIOND_IMAGE=ghcr.io/product-science/versiond:0.2.15
export PROXY_ROUTER_IMAGE=<previous proxy image>
export PROXY_POLICY_IMAGE=<previous proxy image>
export VERSIOND_ROUTER_IMAGE=<previous router image>
./update-devshard.sh
```

Persist the values in `config.env` if the rollback should survive the next
run. Rolling back to the v0.2.15 nginx `proxy` and `versiond-router` needs the
previous Compose files as well (`git checkout <previous release> -- deploy/join`).

PostgreSQL is outside that rule. The v4 anonymous volume remains attached and
unmodified after the copy, but once the persistent database has accepted
writes, switching back to the volume would fork the history. Treat a problem
after that point as database recovery; see
[postgres-persistence-migration.md](./postgres-persistence-migration.md).

## Fresh HA installation

```bash
cd deploy/join
source ./config.env
./versiond-router-fleet.sh prepare-networks
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.versiond.yml up -d --wait
./versiond-router-fleet.sh apply
```

For managed PostgreSQL, add `docker-compose.versiond-external-postgres.yml` and
an operator override that sets the same `PGHOST`, `PGPORT`, `PGDATABASE`,
`PGUSER` and `PGPASSWORD` on every versiond service. Use only those variables:
`update-devshard.sh --check` rejects `DATABASE_URL`, `PGSERVICE`,
`PGSERVICEFILE` and `PGOPTIONS` on HA replicas, because a service file or a
session option such as `search_path` can send one process to a different
database than the tuple everybody else agreed on. Keep the same ordered
`-f` list, or `COMPOSE_FILE`, for every later command.

Size the server's `max_connections` for at least
`R * (2 * N * (P + 2) + 5)` non-reserved connections, where `R` is the number
of versiond replicas, `N` the number of HA devshard children each replica runs
(one per HA version) and `P` the `DEVSHARD_POSTGRES_POOL_MAX_CONNS` pool limit
(default 4). Every replica runs its own children, so the child term counts per
replica; the doubled child term covers the draining predecessor a version may
keep during a rolling binary update; the per-replica term is versiond's
session-lookup pool plus one schema-initializer session. With two replicas,
three HA versions and the default pool that is 82 connections; three replicas
need 123.

The updater checks this bound against `max_connections` minus PostgreSQL's
reserved slots before replacing services. It uses the declared HA versions
plus versions in live local proofs, the largest configured or observed local
pool limit, and the union of local writers and declared pool membership.
Local writers include candidates about to start and running replicas marked
for removal. Entries addressed by a local Compose service or container name
on port 8080 are counted once; repeated remote host/port pairs are also counted
once. Router endpoint IDs do not identify writers. Other aliases and IP
addresses are counted as additional members because their equivalence to a
local writer cannot be established from the configuration alone.
Remote replicas must fit those version and pool limits. Set
`UPDATE_POSTGRES_CONNECTION_RESERVE` for connections used by other applications
or additional capacity requirements. This is a configuration bound; it does
not reserve server connections or guarantee availability during a database
outage. A fresh bundled database is checked on subsequent updates, once it is
running.

## Day-2 operations

| Task | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Update to a later release | `./update-devshard.sh` |
| Take `versiond2` out temporarily | `docker compose stop versiond2` |
| Put it back | `docker compose up -d --no-deps --wait versiond2` |
| Decommission `versiond2` | set `VERSIOND2_REPLICAS=0` in `config.env`, then `stop` and `rm` it |
| Add a third local replica | add `docker-compose.versiond3.yml` to the file list, `docker compose up -d --no-deps --wait versiond3` |
| Roll the router image or settings | edit `config.env`, then `./versiond-router-fleet.sh apply` |
| Inspect the fleet | `./versiond-router-fleet.sh status` |
| Wait for a newly approved version on this host | `./versiond-router-fleet.sh wait-version v9` |

The number of local replicas is not fixed. `docker-compose.versiond3.yml`
defines `versiond3` by extending the shipped `versiond2` service with its own
data directory and `VERSIOND3_REPLICAS`; copy it for `versiond4` and beyond.
Every replica joins the `versiond-pool` alias, so the routers find it without
configuration; the DNS pool holds up to 64 members
(`VERSIOND_ROUTER_POOL_SLOTS`). Keep `VERSIOND_ROUTING_ACTIVATION_MIN_READY`
at or below the number of replicas you run.

`versiond-router-fleet.sh maintenance-rollout` (placement changes: legacy
pins, pool name, coarse mode) is an acknowledged outage window. If it is
interrupted, run it again: slots already on the new placement are kept, the
rest are replaced. Its automatic rollback covers the slots the current run
captured; slots finished by an earlier interrupted run stay on the new
placement. The endpoint list is not part of that snapshot: a rolled-back
router runs the previous image with the current list, because the list is
the operator's desired membership, not a generation of the router.

Bundled PostgreSQL: a crashed postmaster is restarted by Docker
(`restart: always`); a hung one is reported unhealthy and needs an operator
(`docker compose restart devshard-postgres`). Runtime recovery inside
devshardd (fence budget, reconnect backoff, readiness of the write path) is
tracked separately from this deployment tooling.

The router slots are not part of the main Compose project. Before a full
`docker compose down`, run `./versiond-router-fleet.sh stop-all --maintenance`;
after it, `./versiond-router-fleet.sh down --maintenance`.

## Multi-host versiond

The router pool is normally the `versiond-pool` DNS alias of the Compose
network, which only local containers can join. To run versiond on other
machines, list the members explicitly. The routers then check each listed
address and keep the same consistent-hash placement on every slot.

On the **network node**:

1. Create `deploy/join/versiond-endpoints.json` (see
   `versiond-endpoints.example.json`). Local replicas are listed by container
   name, remote ones by private IP and port:

   ```json
   [
     { "id": "versiond",   "host": "versiond",   "port": 8080 },
     { "id": "versiond2",  "host": "versiond2",  "port": 8080 },
     { "id": "versiond-b", "host": "10.20.0.12", "port": 8080 }
   ]
   ```

2. In `config.env` set `VERSIOND_POOL_ENDPOINTS_FILE=./versiond-endpoints.json`
   and `GONKA_PRIVATE_BIND_IP=<private address of this machine>`.
3. Add `docker-compose.private-endpoints.yml` after
   `docker-compose.versiond.yml` in every Compose command (or in
   `COMPOSE_FILE`) and apply it: `docker compose ... up -d --no-deps node api
   devshard-postgres`. It publishes chain gRPC/RPC, the node manager and
   PostgreSQL on the private interface only. Firewall those ports from the
   public network.
4. After the remote replicas pass the database check described below,
   admit them using the fleet commands below.

On each **remote machine**:

1. Clone the same release, copy `config.env` from the network node, and set
   `NETWORK_NODE_PRIVATE_IP` and `VERSIOND_BIND_IP` (this machine's private
   address, the one written in the endpoint file).
2. Copy `.inference/keyring-file` from the network node into `./.inference`;
   the same `KEY_NAME` and `KEYRING_PASSWORD` apply.
3. `docker compose -f docker-compose.versiond-remote.yml up -d --wait`.
4. Install `psql` (the PostgreSQL client) and `jq` on this host. Copy
   `pool-postgres.env.template` to `pool-postgres.env`, set its permissions
   to `600`, and fill it with the existing pool's known working PostgreSQL
   connection settings. Obtain these independently of the replica being
   checked; certificate paths refer to files on this host. Then run:

   ```bash
   ./update-devshard.sh --check-storage --reference-env ./pool-postgres.env
   ```

   Continue only when it prints `Storage check passed` and exits with code 0.
   It checks the running `versiond` container without requiring the network
   node's Compose services. For other container names, supply `--container NAME`
   (repeat for several). Each HA devshardd writes a control value through its
   own database connection, and the checker reads it from the reference
   database. Run checks one host at a time, with no updater running elsewhere.
5. Admit the checked replicas on the network node. For a new fleet, run
   `./versiond-router-fleet.sh apply`. Changing an existing fleet's endpoint
   list requires a maintenance window:

   ```bash
   VERSIOND_ROUTER_ALLOW_MAINTENANCE_OUTAGE=true \
     ./versiond-router-fleet.sh maintenance-rollout
   ./versiond-router-fleet.sh verify-admission
   ```

Update remote hosts one at a time. Stop the remote service with
`docker compose -f docker-compose.versiond-remote.yml stop versiond` and let
it finish draining. Remove its entry from the endpoint file and apply that
membership change using the maintenance procedure above before starting
its replacement. On the remote host, run
`docker compose -f docker-compose.versiond-remote.yml pull`, then
`docker compose -f docker-compose.versiond-remote.yml up -d --wait`.
Repeat the database check before restoring its entry through the same
membership maintenance procedure.
Versions in `VERSIOND_NON_HA_VERSIONS` stay on `VERSIOND_LEGACY_HOST` (the
network node's `versiond` by default) because their state is local SQLite.

The endpoint file wins over DNS. A pre-HAProxy `VERSIOND_HOSTS` value in
`config.env` is still honoured by the fleet, but prefer the file. Each router
generation keeps its own copy of the list; editing the file does not change
running membership. Ordinary `apply` refuses a changed membership contract.
The maintenance procedure drains the old fleet before admitting the new
list, so active slots agree on session placement. A session assigned to
another versiond recovers its state from shared PostgreSQL. The shared
PostgreSQL remains a single host-local process in this layout; multi-host
production needs a managed PostgreSQL with synchronous durability.

## Validation

- `shellcheck -x deploy/join/update-devshard.sh deploy/join/updater-rollback.sh deploy/join/update-devshard_test.sh`
- `deploy/join/update-devshard_test.sh` (command sequence, proof failures, offline guard, capacity and utilities)
- `python3 deploy/join/updater-postgres_test.py` (data-target refusal, durable PostgreSQL recovery, post-start history verification)
- `python3 deploy/join/updater-rollback_test.py` (real Docker rollback, lock contention, interrupted recovery and no-op retention)
- `python3 deploy/join/versiond-storage-check_test.py` (real PostgreSQL lineage, per-generation challenges and capacity boundary)
- `deploy/join/update-devshard-e2e_test.sh` (v4-to-v5 migration, public admission failure and nginx restoration, retry)
- `deploy/join/versiond-compose-config_test.sh` (Compose contract, endpoint overlay)
- `make -C versiond-router test-render` (includes the endpoint list rendering)
- `make -C versiond-router test-fleet` (real Docker fleet rollout)
- `deploy/join/devshard-postgres-upgrade_test.sh` (real v4 volume migration)

### Warm-cutover test coverage

The warm cutover is pinned at three layers:

- **Unit — `devshardd` body shape** (`devshard/cmd/devshardd/lifecycle_test.go`):
  `/ready` returns 200 while recovery is still draining and flips the body's
  `recovery_complete` to `true` only after `WaitRecoveryRepairs` returns;
  draining stays 503.
- **Unit — `versiond` wait + bail-outs**
  (`versioned/internal/process/manager_recovery_wait_test.go`): the overlap
  wait returns on `recovery_complete: true`; skips on an absent field (pre-v5
  child) and on a legacy child with no admin listener; publishes immediately on
  old-child death; aborts on `hostDraining`, context cancel, and
  `VERSIOND_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT` (old keeps serving). A pin test asserts
  `watchChildReadiness` never reads the body, so recovery never evicts the host
  from the HAProxy pool. Two guard tests cover the quiet failure modes: an
  unset `RecoveryTimeout` must normalize to 30m (a zero value would make
  `context.WithTimeout` expire instantly and abort *every* overlap swap), and a
  non-postgres pair must stay overlap-ineligible so the stop/start branch never
  reaches the wait.
- **Integration — testenv boot tests**
  (`devshard/testenv/citest/versiond_warm_cutover_test.go`,
  `make citest-versiond-warm-cutover`): `TestVersiondWarmCutoverBoot` pins the
  status-vs-body split end to end — the public `/healthz` is 200 with
  `VERSIOND_RECOVERY_TIMEOUT` configured and a chat round-trip serves after
  boot.   `TestVersiondWarmCutoverOverlapWaitsThenServes` pins the swap half — a
  SHA flip drives the new sha to `running` on the target host (which only
  happens after the warm wait returns and `downloadAndSwap` publishes; a
  timed-out wait would abort the swap and the new sha would never run), new
  traffic serves, and the old child retires. The admin `/ready` body is loopback inside the versiond container on
  a dynamic port, so the body field and bail-outs are unit-pinned; the testenv
  suite pins the end-to-end effect (the wait returns, the swap completes). See
  [`testenv/docs/scenarios.md`](../testenv/docs/scenarios.md) §"Versiond warm
  cutover".

## Known limits

- The public `proxy-router` is one process on one host. A provider LB, VIP or
  Kubernetes Service above several hosts is later work.
- The bundled PostgreSQL is not database HA.
- Removing a governance version from the routers requires a maintenance
  procedure; runtime projection is additions-only.
- Multi-host is manual in this release: no remote execution, no coordinator.
