# versiond-router

HAProxy in front of N `versiond` instances. Production Compose runs several
independent copies as a fleet behind `proxy-router`; every copy has two jobs:

1. **Stickiness** — every request for one session lands on the same `versiond`,
   so the instance holding that session's hot state keeps serving it.
2. **Membership and health** — a `versiond` that is starting, draining, or gone
   must not receive new work, and must start receiving it again on its own once
   it is healthy.

Membership comes from DNS, health from active checks, and protocol names from
the existing governance `/versions` feed. The only persistent router state is a
last-known-good catalog projection. Adding a host or approving a protocol name
does not require a router reload.

Fleet replicas do not coordinate or share mutable routing state. Given the same
catalog, placement settings, DNS membership and health view, each independently
builds the same address-keyed hash ring.

---

## How it decides where to send a request

```text
request → normalise path → pick backend by version → pick server by escrow id
```

| Backend | Servers | Used for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `versiond_pool_<v>` / `versiond_dynamic_<n>` | every host that passes the per-version readiness sequence below | bootstrap versions and names learned from governance |
| `versiond_legacy_<v>` | the single `VERSIOND_LEGACY_HOST` when it passes the same sequence | one per version in `VERSIOND_NON_HA_VERSIONS`, which owns pre-HA SQLite data on that host |
| `versiond_ha_pool` | every host that passes the coarse readiness sequence | non-version paths such as `/healthz`, and every version when no version is declared at all |

A version absent from both the bootstrap set and the accepted governance
catalog is refused with `503`, rather than being routed to a host that may not
run it. See [Version catalog](#version-catalog).

Every backend is rendered from `pool-backend.cfg.template`, so the routing
policy cannot drift between them. HA backends use the DNS pool; each legacy
backend uses one slot pointed at the explicit SQLite owner.

Within `versiond_ha_pool` the server is chosen by **consistent hash** of the
escrow id taken from the path (`/{version}/sessions/{escrow}/...`); other paths
hash by the path itself so non-session traffic still spreads. Consistent hashing
means adding or removing one host re-homes roughly `1/N` of sessions instead of
reshuffling all of them.

The ring is keyed on each server's **address** (`hash-key addr`), not on the
`server-template` slot it happens to occupy. That distinction is load-bearing:
DNS hands the router its answers in no particular order, so with the default
slot-id key a plain router restart could put the same hosts in different slots
and re-home every session at once. Keyed on the address, the ring depends on who
is in the pool rather than on the order they were discovered in. A host that is
recreated with a new IP does move on the ring — that is an ordinary membership
change, bounded to its own share of sessions.

The hash key is always derived from the URL and never taken from a request
header. It selects the upstream, so a client-supplied key would let a caller pin
itself to a host of its choosing.

An optional `/devshard/` prefix (present when genesis-proxy is not in front) is
normalised away before routing and stripped before forwarding.

## Membership: DNS

`VERSIOND_POOL_HOST` is one DNS name that resolves to **every** instance in the
pool. Under Docker Compose that is a network alias:

```yaml
x-versiond: &versiond
  networks:
    default:
      aliases:
        - versiond-pool
```

Both `versiond` containers answer to `versiond-pool`, so the name has one A
record per running instance. HAProxy re-resolves it every second
(`resolvers docker`) and fills a fixed set of `server-template` slots. Start a
third instance with the same alias and it appears in the pool within a couple of
seconds; stop one and its slot empties.

`VERSIOND_ROUTER_POOL_SLOTS` (default 64) caps how many instances can be in the
pool at once. Unused slots cost nothing; they exist because HAProxy allocates
server slots at startup.

## Membership: explicit endpoint list

DNS discovery only sees containers that share a Docker network with the
router. Bare-metal deployments that run `versiond` on other machines list the
members explicitly in a JSON file and point `VERSIOND_POOL_ENDPOINTS_FILE` at
it:

```json
[
  { "id": "versiond",   "host": "versiond",   "port": 8080 },
  { "id": "versiond-b", "host": "10.20.0.12", "port": 8080 },
  { "id": "versiond-c", "host": "10.20.0.13", "port": 18080 }
]
```

- `id` names the member (`[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._-]*`, unique).
- `host` is an IPv4 address or a DNS name. A name keeps re-resolving through the
  Docker resolver, so a local container listed by its container name rejoins
  after it is recreated with a new address. IPv6 literals are not supported.
- `port` defaults to `VERSIOND_PORT`.

When the file is set it replaces DNS discovery for every HA backend: each entry
becomes one `server versiond<n>` line with the same active checks,
`init-state fully-down`, and `hash-key addr` as the DNS template, so every
router computes the same ring from the same list. The catalog reconciler
addresses `versiond1..versiondN`, so the list is also the pool capacity: an
unlisted host cannot join, and `VERSIOND_ROUTING_ACTIVATION_MIN_READY` must not
exceed the number of entries.

`VERSIOND_LEGACY_HOST` may name an entry by `id`; the legacy backends then use
that entry's host and port. Any other value keeps the single-host DNS contract.

The pre-HAProxy `VERSIOND_HOSTS` list (whitespace or comma separated, entries
optionally `host:port`) is still accepted and renders the same explicit list.
It is ignored when an endpoint file is set. Prefer the file for new
deployments.

In `deploy/join`, set `VERSIOND_POOL_ENDPOINTS_FILE` in `config.env` (a relative
path is resolved from the directory of `config.env`) and run
`./versiond-router-fleet.sh apply`; the fleet mounts the file into every slot,
includes its SHA-256 in the slot contract, and rolls the slots one at a time
after an edit.

## Health: one question per version

A pool-wide "are you healthy" cannot say that a host is missing *one* of several
versions. So the router asks about the version it is about to route to. Each
version in `VERSIOND_VERSIONS` gets its own backend over the HA hosts, and each
version in `VERSIOND_NON_HA_VERSIONS` gets its own backend over the one legacy
host. Each check performs two requests:

1. `GET /readyz?version=<v>` must return `200`, or `404` from a pre-v5
   `versiond` that does not implement this capability.
2. `GET /<v>/healthz` must return `200`, proving that the actual route exists.

The coarse backend uses the same sequence with `/readyz` and `/healthz`.
`503` from a v5 readiness endpoint is always a failed check, so a starting or
draining v5 host still leaves the pool before admission closes. The `404`
fallback exists only to keep a restored v4 image routable during the v5 cutover;
it is never sufficient without the successful route-health request.

A host that cannot run `v5` — its download failed, its child will not start —
answers `503` for `?version=v5` and `200` for `?version=v4`. It leaves `v5`'s
backend and keeps serving `v4`. This also applies to the legacy owner: a failed
new archive cannot hide its healthy pinned versions. Nothing else changes: no
eviction, no reload.

That also makes rolling out a version safe once it is declared. Until a host has
`v6` running it is not in `v6`'s pool, so `v6` traffic goes only to hosts that can
serve it, while `v4` and `v5` carry on untouched. Compare the alternative of one
host-wide readiness flag: the moment governance approves `v6`, *every* host would
be missing it at once, and gating on that would empty the whole pool.

Every second HAProxy runs the complete sequence against each host.

## Version catalog

`VERSIOND_VERSIONS` is a bootstrap floor used while the governance endpoint is
unavailable. In normal operation the router polls `VERSIOND_ROUTING_CATALOG_URL`,
the same read-only `/versions` snapshot consumed by versiond.

The current `/versions` response has no monotonic revision, block height, or
source timestamp. The router can detect transport failures and invalid payloads,
but it must treat every valid `200` snapshot as current. The cache's
`fetched_at_unix` records when this router accepted the response; it does not
prove governance freshness. Detecting a reachable endpoint that indefinitely
serves an older valid snapshot requires a revision in the upstream contract.

The join Compose file keeps that URL empty while its default image is the
published legacy nginx router. Release automation activates this capability by
supplying a published `VERSIOND_ROUTER_IMAGE` tag or digest together with the
catalog URL; the Compose YAML does not name an image before it exists. Its
healthcheck verifies the selected image's catalog capability instead of trusting
those two values independently: a catalog-capable image without the URL, or the
legacy image with the URL, remains unhealthy. The router is an optional startup
dependency of the shared public proxy: the mismatch remains visible to Compose
and causes `up --wait` to fail, but it does not prevent unrelated public APIs
from starting.

HAProxy cannot create backends at runtime, so the image pre-renders a bounded
set of disabled `versiond_dynamic_<n>` backends. For every new valid name the
reconciler assigns a slot, enables its per-version checks, waits until the
configured ready reserve is present, then publishes the request-map entry.
Admission is independent per version: an unavailable candidate remains staged
without blocking another candidate that has reached its reserve.

The current source has no monotonic revision, so normal reconciliation is
additions-only. A snapshot that omits an accepted name leaves its route and
cache entry intact and reports `withdrawal-pending`; the backend's active check
still returns `503` once no versiond can serve it. Planned removal requires a
supervised maintenance run with
`VERSIOND_ROUTING_CATALOG_ALLOW_REMOVALS=true`, after which the slot becomes
reusable. A maintenance snapshot that adds and removes names is applied in two
durable phases: ready additions are published independently, but omitted routes
are retired only after every addition has spare capacity and has passed its
ready reserve. If an addition cannot be staged, the old route and cache entry
remain in place; slot capacity must therefore include the intended replacement
overlap. A completely empty response remains fail-closed while accepted routes
exist because versiond applies the same misconfiguration guard.

Accepted projections are written atomically under `/var/lib/gonka-router`.
After restart, a validated last-known-good cache keeps already learned routes
alive while governance is temporarily unavailable, regardless of its local age.
The cache age threshold produces a stale diagnostic but never revokes an
accepted route. A timestamp ahead of the local clock is likewise treated as
stale, preserving routes across host clock rollback; the first successful fresh
catalog observation normalizes that timestamp. Corrupt caches and
malformed, empty, or capacity-exhaustion
source inputs leave the last accepted routing map untouched and expose a
degraded state through `catalog-status`.
If only the supervised reconciler restarts while HAProxy remains live, a missing
or corrupt cache is rebuilt from a consistent live projection before any repair
is allowed to remove a route.
Steady polls verify the complete accepted map/slot relationship in one pass and
skip projection planning when the source has not changed. Slot activation and
retirement send one Runtime API batch per backend, then verify the resulting
HAProxy state; they do not open one socket per pre-rendered server.
Catalog-enabled Compose deployments mount that directory from a named volume so
container replacement does not discard the last-known-good projection.
While a valid catalog addition is waiting for capacity or its ready reserve, the
router refreshes only the accepted cache subset. This keeps existing routes
restart-safe without making the pending name visible.

The router cache preserves routing state, not the complete version artifact
catalog. It therefore protects a router replacement while the existing versiond
children keep running, but it cannot bootstrap those children after every
versiond process has restarted. A full-stack start still requires the `/versions`
source to become reachable; until then the restored router routes have no ready
upstreams. Persisting and replaying the artifact catalog in the versiond
supervisor is a separate recovery contract, outside this router.

Names learned dynamically from the catalog use the routing grammar
`[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._+~-]{0,63}`. Names outside it are rejected before they
can create a path/map or Runtime API mismatch. Because the current governance
contract accepts a wider set of basenames, one incompatible name is isolated rather than
rejecting the whole snapshot: accepted routes remain, compatible additions can
still converge, and `catalog-status` reports `contract-error`. The incompatible
route itself remains
unpublished and returns `503` until governance corrects its name.

Static bootstrap and legacy lists keep the previous, wider path-segment contract,
so an existing declaration such as `v1:beta` remains valid. Static names still
reject `/`, `?`, `#`, `%`, whitespace, quotes, backslashes, `.` and `..`. A name
outside the dynamic grammar must remain explicitly declared; it cannot later be
adopted from the governance catalog without a compatible rename.

Leaving both the bootstrap set and catalog URL empty selects coarse host-level
routing. An HA deployment refuses that mode unless
`VERSIOND_ROUTER_ALLOW_COARSE_READINESS=1` is explicit.

For `/readyz?version=<v>`, a lifecycle-aware `versiond` answers `200` only while
it accepts traffic and has a running child serving exactly that version. The
unqualified `/readyz` is the corresponding host-level answer. Returning `503`
withdraws the host from the affected backend. A legacy process returns `404`,
so the second route-health request remains the compatibility contract until the
lifecycle-aware image has been rolled out.

| Setting | Value | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `inter 1s` | check every second | membership changes are observed promptly |
| `fall 1` | one failed check removes the host | explicit unreadiness is authoritative |
| `rise 2` | two passing checks restore it | do not flap a host back in on one lucky probe |

A host that has never converged reports `503` on the host-level check until it
has run its full desired set. After that the latch holds: downloading a new
archive does not retract readiness, and a version whose child is restarting drops
out of *that version's* pool alone while the rest keep serving.

## Failure handling

```haproxy
retry-on conn-failure empty-response 502
retries 2
option redispatch
http-request disable-l7-retry if !METH_GET !METH_HEAD !METH_OPTIONS
```

Retries cover the cases where the request provably did not run: the connection
failed, the peer closed without answering, or an upstream proxy answered `502`.

**`503` is never retried.** It is the answer a draining host and the HA storage
guard give, and retrying it would hit the same condition on the next host.

The coarse backend additionally retries `404` for idempotent versionless
session-observability reads. After membership changes, that state may still be
owned by another healthy host. Per-version backends treat `404` as authoritative
and never retry it.

**Non-idempotent requests are never replayed.** `disable-l7-retry` leaves
connection-level redispatch in place for `POST`, but forbids re-sending a
request that may already have been executed — an inference must not run twice.

`http-reuse safe` never reuses a pooled connection for a request that could not
be replayed if the reuse raced with the peer closing it.

## Streaming

Inference responses are long-lived SSE streams. HAProxy does not buffer them.
SSE remains a normal HTX response, so `timeout client` and `timeout server` are
its inactivity limits: the stream can live longer than the configured value as
long as data continues to flow within that interval.

| Setting | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_STREAM_IDLE_SECONDS` | `1200` | `timeout client` / `timeout server`: idle time allowed on a stream |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_TUNNEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `86400` | idle timeout after HTTP Upgrade/CONNECT; does not apply to SSE |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `2` | connect to an upstream, and header read timeout |

The SSE and tunnel settings control different HAProxy modes and are independent.
Reducing `VERSIOND_ROUTER_STREAM_IDLE_SECONDS` reduces the maximum quiet period
inside an SSE response; a larger tunnel timeout does not override it.

## The `Devshard-Ha` header

The router strips every client-supplied `Devshard-Ha` value, then stamps
`Devshard-Ha: true` on HA-pool requests when either the deployment declares
`GONKA_HA` or more than one server is currently usable in the backend selected
for that request. A per-version pool can therefore fail closed even while the
coarse host-level pool sees only one ready server.
`devshardd` uses it to refuse work it cannot safely serve: if this child's
storage is local (SQLite), a sibling could be serving the same escrow, so it
answers `503` rather than fork the session's state.

Every `versiond_legacy_<v>` backend strips the header: each has exactly one
server by definition, so no sibling can exist. Responses keep the stable
`X-Versiond-Backend: versiond_legacy` diagnostic label; the internal suffix is
only how HAProxy keeps the health results separate.

`GONKA_HA` describes the deployment, so the HA overlay sets it for the router
and every versiond host. It is the authoritative latch: it keeps the guard on
when siblings are temporarily unavailable. The runtime server count is a
fail-closed fallback for an accidentally scaled pool, not a substitute for the
deployment declaration.

The overlay also gives versiond the same `VERSIOND_NON_HA_VERSIONS` value as the
router. Before starting a child, versiond requires the Postgres storage contract
for every HA-routed version and refuses a legacy binary that cannot report its
storage mode. For a version pinned to the single legacy owner, versiond passes
`GONKA_HA=false` to that child to match the router backend that strips the HA
marker.

## Looking at the pool

`deploy/join/versiond-router-fleet.sh status` validates every expected slot and
its admission through the active parent proxy. To inspect one slot's measured
versiond pool, run its internal `pool-status` diagnostic; output looks like:

```text
versiond_pool_v4
  versiond1  172.30.0.10  UP
  versiond2  172.30.0.11  DOWN
  1 server(s) taking traffic
versiond_ha_pool
  versiond1  172.30.0.10  UP
  versiond2  172.30.0.11  UP
  2 server(s) taking traffic
```

One host is a separate server in every applicable backend, with its own health,
so the same host can be serving `v4` and out of `v5`. Pinned versions appear as
internal `versiond_legacy_<v>` backends, although their response header remains
`versiond_legacy`. `pool-status` itself performs only `show` commands: it is a
formatter over the HAProxy Runtime API (`/var/run/haproxy/haproxy.sock`), kept
off PATH because it is an internal diagnostic whose output the acceptance-test
harness parses, not an operator CLI. The raw socket is not a read-only security
interface; HAProxy permits map mutations even at its minimum `user` command
level.

**There is no manual drain.** There was, and it was wrong: HAProxy identifies a
server by its slot in a `server-template`, and slots are reused. A drained host
that leaves DNS frees its slot, the next host to arrive lands in it and inherits
the drain — kept out of rotation with nothing to show why. Admin state belongs to
the identity of a process; the router only ever knows an address DNS lent it.

To take a host out of rotation, make its readiness endpoint fail and keep the
process serving long enough for the active check to observe that state. Legacy
`versiond` images do not implement that lifecycle contract; for them the router
can only react after route health fails or the process leaves DNS. The graceful
host lifecycle is intentionally delivered as a separate change.

The router fleet itself is managed with `versiond-router-fleet.sh`. `apply`
bootstraps missing slots and rolls changed ones while preserving
`VERSIOND_ROUTER_MIN_READY`; `rollout` forces that rolling reconciliation;
`maintenance-rollout` is required for placement-contract changes that cannot
mix old and new rings. Before replacing a slot, the fleet drains every matching
coarse and per-version server in the parent HAProxy and confirms withdrawal.
After the old process stops, those servers are reset to health `DOWN`; the new
address must complete a fresh L7 `rise` before it is admitted. Whole-node
maintenance uses `stop-all --maintenance`, then `down --maintenance` after the
main Compose project is down. Fleet resources are ownership-labelled, so
cleanup does not cross into another fleet.

A fresh installation has three ordered phases:

```sh
./versiond-router-fleet.sh prepare-networks
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.versiond.yml up -d
./versiond-router-fleet.sh apply
```

The first command creates the external front/back networks consumed by the main
Compose project. The main project then creates its default metrics network;
`apply` discovers that network and starts the independent slot projects. Set
`VERSIOND_ROUTER_METRICS_NETWORK` explicitly when rendering `spec-hash` before
the main project exists. The release updater owns this ordering for existing
hosts and preserves any additional Compose overlays.

If a host crash interrupts an operation after the parent entered runtime
`DRAIN`, `status` reports incomplete parent admission. The next `up`, `apply`,
`rollout`, or `start` repairs `DRAIN` entries that still point at a live fleet
slot: it resets their health to `DOWN`, returns them to `READY`, and waits for a
fresh L7 rise. This avoids restarting the public proxy and never admits the
replacement from inherited health state.

Fleet slots preserve `X-Real-IP` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` from the policy tier.
Their data listener is reachable only through the fleet-owned front network;
the public/policy proxy is responsible for deriving those headers from the
external connection before forwarding a request there.

Do not stop or recreate slot projects with raw `docker compose` commands.
`stop`, `start`, `rollout`, and `maintenance-rollout` provide the parent drain,
fresh-health boundary, and long SSE drain budget. Before taking the main Compose
project down, run `stop-all --maintenance`; after the main project is down, use
`down --maintenance` to remove the slot projects and fleet-owned networks.
`status`, `verify-admission`, and `wait-version` are read-only and remain
available while a mutating fleet or host-update operation holds the deployment
lock.

## Configuration

| `VERSIOND_PORT` | `8080` | upstream port and the default endpoint port |
| `VERSIOND_LEGACY_HOST` | *(none)* | single host owning pre-HA SQLite data dirs. **Required** whenever `VERSIOND_NON_HA_VERSIONS` is non-empty — the router refuses to start otherwise, because the owner of one host's data cannot default to a name that resolves to the whole pool. Unused (and may be omitted) when no version is pinned |
| `VERSIOND_NON_HA_VERSIONS` | *(empty)* | static version path segments pinned to the legacy host, whitespace and/or comma separated; retains the wider path-safe startup grammar described above |
| `VERSIOND_VERSIONS` | *(empty)* | static bootstrap floor using the wider path-safe startup grammar; compatible governance additions are learned without changing it |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTING_CATALOG_URL` | *(empty)* | read-only governance `GET /versions` endpoint |

| `VERSIOND_ROUTING_CATALOG_ALLOW_REMOVALS` | *(unset/false)* | allow an accepted dynamic route to be removed when omitted by a later snapshot. Keep disabled during normal operation; use only in a supervised maintenance window because the source has no monotonic revision |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTING_CATALOG_CACHE_MAX_AGE_SECONDS` | `86400` | age after which startup reports the validated last-known-good catalog as stale; accepted routes are still restored |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_VERSION_CAPACITY` | `32` | pre-rendered slots for names added after startup |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_ALLOW_COARSE_READINESS` | *(unset)* | allow an HA deployment to run with no declared versions, accepting that a host with one unready version keeps receiving its traffic. Same boolean grammar |
| `GONKA_HA` | *(unset)* | authoritative HA deployment latch; stamps `Devshard-Ha` even while only one pool member is usable. With it off, the router still stamps the header whenever more than one host is usable in the selected backend. Booleans share one grammar with devshardd: `1/t/true/yes/on` on, empty/`0/f/false/no/off` off, anything else refuses to start |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_ADMIN_PORT` | `8404` | internal liveness/readiness listener port; the shipped Compose healthcheck follows this value |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_FRONT_BIND_HOST` | *(empty)* | optional container hostname whose IPv4 address receives the data and admin listeners. Empty binds both listeners on all container interfaces; a named interface keeps an additional loopback admin bind |

| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_METRICS_BIND_HOST` | *(empty)* | optional container hostname whose IPv4 address receives a second metrics bind. Metrics always remain available on loopback; fleet slots bind their metrics-network address and share the `versiond-router-metrics` discovery alias |
| `HAPROXY_DNS_RESOLVER` | `127.0.0.11:53` | numeric DNS resolver address, with an optional port, used by HAProxy `server-template` slots |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_POOL_SLOTS` | `64` | maximum simultaneous pool members; catalog mode supports up to `256`, keeping each atomic server-state Runtime API batch below HAProxy's default command buffer. The resolver accepts DNS payloads up to 8192 bytes so the default pool fits in one answer |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_MAX_CONNECTIONS` | `4096` | frontend `maxconn` |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `10485760` | early 413 for an advertised `Content-Length` above this value. `devshardd` independently caps actual bytes at 10 MiB, including chunked bodies and direct-router traffic |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_CONNECT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `2` | connect and header timeouts |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_STREAM_IDLE_SECONDS` | `1200` | client/server idle timeout |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_TUNNEL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` | `86400` | upgraded/CONNECT idle timeout; independent of SSE |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_ADMIN_PORT` | `8404` | private live/readiness listener consumed by the parent proxy and fleet checks |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_FRONT_BIND_HOST` | *(all interfaces)* | per-slot front-network address used for data and admin listeners |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_METRICS_BIND_HOST` | *(loopback)* | per-slot metrics-network address |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_METRICS_NETWORK` | *(auto-detected)* | main Compose network used for Prometheus discovery |
| `HAPROXY_DNS_RESOLVER` | `127.0.0.11:53` | numeric resolver; part of the fleet placement contract |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_STOP_GRACE_PERIOD` | `10s` | routine Compose cleanup ceiling; fleet rollout supplies its own drain deadline |
| `VERSIOND_ROUTER_ALLOW_MAINTENANCE_OUTAGE` | `false` | explicit one-command acknowledgement for `maintenance-rollout` |

The entrypoint validates every numeric setting, renders `haproxy.cfg` and
`non_ha.map`, runs `haproxy -c` on the result, and only then execs HAProxy. A bad
value fails the container immediately instead of producing a subtly wrong
config. Version pinning is startup configuration because each pin needs its own
health-checked backend; change `VERSIOND_NON_HA_VERSIONS` and replace the router
container to change it.

The shipped join overlay distinguishes unset from explicitly empty values.
Unset `VERSIOND_NON_HA_VERSIONS` and `VERSIOND_VERSIONS` receive the deployment
defaults; an empty export reaches this entrypoint unchanged. Coarse mode needs
both `VERSIOND_VERSIONS=""` and
`VERSIOND_ROUTER_ALLOW_COARSE_READINESS=true`.

Declared names are used three ways, and each is derived to suit itself: the map
key is the name exactly as governance wrote it, because it is matched against the
path segment; the health-check query is percent-encoded, because `+` in a query
decodes to a space and the check would ask about a version that does not exist;
and the backend identifier gets a hash appended when the name is not already a
valid one. A dynamic name outside the catalog grammar documented above is
isolated before any runtime-map mutation; an unrepresentable static path segment
is refused before the config is rendered.

## Observability

| Endpoint | Where | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/metrics` | loopback and the slot's internal metrics-network address | Prometheus exporter; never published on a host port |
| Diagnostic Runtime API | `/var/run/haproxy/haproxy.sock` | local `level user` socket, no TCP bind; raw HAProxy map commands remain writable |
| Reconciler Runtime API | `/var/run/haproxy/reconciler.sock` | local `level admin` socket used for catalog map and server-state changes |
| Admin HTTP | port `8404` inside the container | liveness and readiness only; wildcard-bound by default or restricted to loopback plus `VERSIOND_ROUTER_FRONT_BIND_HOST`; never published on a host port by the shipped Compose files |
| Catalog status | `/usr/local/lib/router-runtime/catalog-status --state` | current reconciler state, independent serving/convergence booleans, and pending activation/capacity counts; reports `stale` when updates stop |
| Accepted-route readiness | `GET http://127.0.0.1:8404/readyz?component=serving` | `200` when the durable accepted set is represented exactly by the live maps; remains ready during source outages and while unrelated additions are staged |
| Catalog readiness | `GET http://127.0.0.1:8404/readyz?component=catalog` | `200` only when the enabled catalog is fully reconciled; independent of data-plane readiness for accepted routes |
| Version readiness | `GET http://127.0.0.1:8404/readyz?version=<v>` | resolves `<v>` through the live route map and reports the selected backend's active-check state; the request is not forwarded upstream |
| `X-Upstream-Addr` | response header | which instance served the request |
| `X-Versiond-Backend` | response header | HA backend name, or the stable `versiond_legacy` label for any pinned version |

The Prometheus output includes two synthetic backends.
`router_catalog_status` reports full desired-state convergence, while
`router_catalog_serving_status` reports that the accepted LKG projection is
intact. A pending version or source outage therefore makes only convergence
red; corruption of an accepted map makes both signals red. Serving readiness is
not proof that every desired future name is available, so a parent that routes
by version must still use per-version readiness. The transitional singleton's
Compose health is only a startup compatibility gate: a catalog-aware image uses
admin `/livez`, while the nginx image retains its `/healthz` probe.
Independently managed fleet slots intentionally use the stricter unqualified
admin `/readyz`, because fleet reserve and rollout commands must count serving
capacity rather than merely live processes. Consequently a complete
versiond-pool outage also blocks fleet mutation until serving capacity returns;
unrelated public APIs remain available through the policy tier.
Catalog diagnostics never include the configured source URL, so credentials or
signed query parameters are not copied into status output or router logs.
Each router image owns its graceful-stop signal: the transitional nginx image
uses `SIGQUIT`, while the HAProxy image declares `SIGUSR1`. The shipped Compose
overlay only bounds the drain with `VERSIOND_ROUTER_STOP_GRACE_PERIOD` (default
`10s`) before Docker forces termination, so selecting one image cannot override
the shutdown contract of the other.

`VERSIOND_ROUTER_PULL_POLICY=always` is the release default and requires the
registry to be reachable before a slot operation. During a registry incident,
an operator may use `missing` only when the intended image or digest is already
present locally; `never` is the fully offline option. Prefer immutable digests
for either offline mode.

Prometheus discovers slots through the shared `versiond-router-metrics` DNS
alias. Alert on the expected target count as well as each target's `up` value:
a Docker DNS failure or removed slot disappears from service discovery instead
of producing an `up == 0` series for its old address.

The shipped Compose files do not publish the admin or metrics listener on a host
port. They can be reached by containers on the same internal network when their
network bind is enabled; both Runtime API sockets remain filesystem-only. The
container runs as the unprivileged `haproxy` user from the base image — root is
used only at build time to install packages and hand over the config and socket
directories. Processes with filesystem access inside the container share that
trust boundary; the two socket levels reduce accidental privilege, not a hostile
same-UID process.

## Tests

```console
$ make test-render
test-hash-ring: ok
test-render: ok
$ make test-fleet
versiond-router-fleet_test: ok
```

`test-render` renders the mixed (legacy pinning) and all-HA shapes, asserts on
the result, checks that invalid settings are rejected, and validates each
rendered config with the real HAProxy from the image the router ships.

`test-version-routing` proves the headline property against the real image: two
upstreams that disagree about which versions they serve, and a host that lacks
one version must receive none of its traffic while still receiving the rest. It
also gives the legacy owner failing generic readiness and proves that a healthy
pinned version remains routable while an unhealthy pinned version stays down.

`test-hash-ring` proves the property that cannot be seen by reading the config:
it takes the hashing directives out of the rendered file, puts the same four
addresses into the server slots in three different orders, and requires every
escrow to reach the same address each time. Remove `hash-key addr` from the
template and it fails, naming the sessions that moved.

Both require Docker.

`test-fleet` starts three slots as separate Compose projects and covers
idempotent apply, ready-reserve enforcement, rolling replacement, placement
maintenance with exact rollback, admission through the parent proxy, and
ownership-bounded teardown of expected and orphan resources.
