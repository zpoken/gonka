# proxy-router

`proxy-router` is the host-local HAProxy at the edge of the Compose deployment.
It has three data-plane responsibilities:

1. expose public TCP listeners on ports 80 and 443 and distribute connections
   across private nginx `proxy-policy` workers with PROXY protocol v2;
2. distribute `/devshard` requests from those workers across ready
   `versiond-router` replicas, using route-specific health checks;
3. expose only DAPI's read-only `GET /versions` catalog on the isolated inner
   router network.

The nginx workers still own TLS, HTTP/2, CORS, rate limits, path rewrites, and
the on-chain route table. This keeps one policy implementation while allowing
the service-pool distributors to scale and restart independently.

## Request path

```text
client
  -> proxy-router :80/:443
  -> proxy-policy2 + proxy-policy (fixed rolling slots)
       -> ordinary and edge-api routes -> existing services
       -> /devshard/* -> proxy-router :18081 -> versiond-router fleet
```

The public-to-policy hop is TCP, so encrypted HTTP/2 remains end-to-end between
the client and nginx. `send-proxy-v2` carries the original source address to the
worker. That listener is bound only to the internal `proxy-policy-front`
network; nginx derives both its bind address and trusted PROXY CIDR from the
`proxy-policy-ingress` peer. Containers on the shared application network
cannot reach or spoof that hop. nginx returns `/devshard` to the private HTTP
frontend on that network; HAProxy then reaches the versiond-router pool through
the isolated `versiond-router-ingress` alias. A catalog-aware inner HAProxy
preserves the client identity derived by the trusted policy tier on this
private hop. Edge
API traffic keeps the pre-existing nginx path in this release: a single worker
targets `edge-api` directly, while the multi-instance overlay targets the
existing `edge-api-router` nginx service.

An external L4 load balancer can preserve client addresses by sending PROXY
protocol and listing only its source CIDRs in
`PROXY_ROUTER_PROXY_PROTOCOL_FROM`. Connections from those CIDRs are rejected
unless they carry a valid PROXY preamble; direct clients from every other source
continue to use ordinary TCP. An L7 load balancer that terminates HTTP must be
configured as an L4 PROXY-protocol hop for this TCP ingress tier rather than
relying on `X-Forwarded-For`.

## Versiond-router selection

Every bootstrap or governance protocol version gets a separate HAProxy backend.
A router is eligible for version `v` only while its data endpoint answers
`/<v>/healthz`. A catalog-aware HAProxy router is additionally required to
answer on its private admin endpoint:

```text
GET http://versiond-router:8404/readyz?version=v
```

The `readyz` health contract therefore verifies both the data listener and the
lifecycle state. The `legacy` contract supports the transitional nginx router,
which has no admin listener, by checking only `/healthz` or
`/<v>/healthz` on port 8080. Versionless requests use the matching coarse check.

Selection among eligible routers uses the same escrow-derived consistent hash
as the inner router. Versioned session paths, versionless session observability
paths, and `/stats/shards/<escrow>` therefore stay on one router replica and one
`versiond` placement. All router replicas use the same pool, hash key, and
legacy pins, so they independently reach the same placement. Their active-check
views can differ briefly around a host failure; for versionless GETs only, a
route-local `404` is retried on another eligible host. POSTs are never replayed
after they may have reached an application. HA versions must use shared
PostgreSQL because affinity is placement, not exclusive ownership.

## Failure boundary

HAProxy retries connection failures, empty responses, and `502` responses. L7
retry is disabled for methods other than GET, HEAD, and OPTIONS. Once a POST may
have reached an application, replaying it could execute the operation twice;
infrastructure cannot safely infer otherwise. Cross-replica idempotency for an
explicit client retry is outside this routing layer and remains unchanged.

An established SSE stream stays on the policy worker, router, versiond host,
and child generation that accepted it. Rolling a replicated inner router or
application member removes it from new selection while that process drains.
The singleton public `proxy-router` is the stated host-level failure boundary:
restarting it interrupts connections crossing that process.

## Membership and state

All pools use Docker DNS plus HAProxy active checks. Protocol names are projected
from dapi's read-only governance `/versions` feed into pre-rendered inactive
backends through a local Unix Runtime API socket. The process has no shared
routing database, leader, or peer protocol. It does not need Redis:

- `proxy-policy-front` resolves to both private nginx policy slots;
- `versiond-router-fleet` resolves to the independently managed router slots on
  the shared front network.

Each policy slot exposes `/health` through its production HTTP and HTTPS
listeners on the isolated policy network. The active check sends the same PROXY
v2 preamble as production traffic, completes HTTP or TLS on that connection,
and requires `/health` to return `200`. The endpoint is backed by the existing
policy sidecar and resolves an alias scoped to the shared application network.
Losing the data listener, PROXY support, that interface, or its Docker DNS view
therefore removes only the affected worker from the corresponding public pool,
while failures of an individual upstream application remain visible at their
own route rather than collapsing the entire policy tier.

Each policy container runs its own sidecar, and a crashed sidecar is restarted
after five seconds. Readiness deliberately remains fail-closed during that
restart: returning a fallback `200` would admit a worker whose application
network has not been verified. A defect shared by the identical sidecar binaries
can therefore withdraw both policy workers at once even while nginx itself is
running; this is a correlated software failure of the policy deployment unit.

`server-template` reserves router capacity and `PROXY_ROUTER_VERSION_CAPACITY`
reserves version-backend capacity. Neither a new router address nor a new
governance name requires a reload. Fresh router and policy slots start fully
down and become eligible only after their configured readiness checks succeed.

HAProxy retains the health state of an occupied slot when Docker DNS changes
its address. A policy-worker replacement therefore follows an explicit
generation boundary: put the old address in runtime drain, confirm withdrawal
from new selection, gracefully stop the worker, reset its health to `DOWN`,
and return the empty slot to check-enabled `READY` state. After the replacement
appears, its address must complete a new L7 `rise` before HAProxy admits it.
The host updater owns this sequence. TCP redispatch moves a new connection to
another admitted worker after the selected address stops accepting connections.

## Availability scope

The nginx policy tier and private versiond-router fleet are process-redundant on
one Docker host. The public `proxy-router` remains one process. Loss of that
host, Docker daemon, public listener, or its network is therefore a host-level
outage. Multi-host ingress belongs in a later layer above this one.

The public router and both `proxy-policy` workers are one Compose deployment
unit. Updating or rolling back that unit applies its image, environment,
network, capability, and service definitions together. The host updater restores
the captured model by targeting these three services explicitly. Unrelated
services and containers owned by other active overlays remain unchanged.

## Endpoints

| Listener | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `:80`, `:443` | public TCP ingress to policy workers |
| policy network `:18081` | private versiond-router distributor |
| `127.0.0.1:8404/livez` | process liveness |
| `127.0.0.1:8404/readyz` | active policy-worker availability |
| `127.0.0.1:8404/readyz?component=versiond` | coarse router-fleet availability |
| `127.0.0.1:8404/readyz?version=<v>` | end-to-end router capacity for one bootstrap or governance version |
| `127.0.0.1:8405/metrics`, `proxy-router-metrics:8405/metrics` | HAProxy Prometheus exporter; internal only, no host port |
| router-back `:9100/versions` | read-only bridge to DAPI's governance catalog; other methods and paths are rejected |
| `/var/run/haproxy/haproxy.sock` | local Runtime API |

The diagnostic Runtime API is a Unix socket with `operator` privileges, which
are sufficient for status inspection but cannot change server state. A separate
mode-600 admin socket is used by the in-container catalog reconciler. The mode
protects the container boundary; it is not process isolation because HAProxy,
entrypoint, and reconciler intentionally run as the same unprivileged Unix user.
They are one trust domain, additionally constrained by dropped capabilities and
`no-new-privileges`. Strong per-process isolation would require a sidecar or a
narrow privileged broker. The loopback admin HTTP listener reports readiness
and cannot mutate routing.

The observability overlay scrapes this tier as the `proxy-router` Prometheus
job and the inner tier as `versiond-router`. Generic readiness intentionally
tracks the policy workers so ordinary APIs remain available during a devshard
incident. Use `/readyz?component=versiond`, per-version readiness, and the
`versiond_router_*` backend metrics from the `proxy-router` job for devshard
availability.

The prefixes identify which contract owns a setting:

- `PROXY_ROUTER_*` configures this outer public distributor.
- `VERSIOND_ROUTER_*` describes the inner router fleet consumed by this tier;
  the same names configure the inner router deployment where applicable.
- `VERSIOND_ROUTING_*` is the catalog projection contract shared by both tiers.

Consequently, `PROXY_ROUTER_ACTIVATION_MIN_READY` is the number of inner routers
the outer tier requires, while `VERSIOND_ROUTING_ACTIVATION_MIN_READY` is the
number of versiond hosts each inner router requires. They are separate reserves,
not aliases.

`VERSIOND_NON_HA_VERSIONS` and the bootstrap `VERSIOND_VERSIONS` must match every
inner router. Runtime additions come from the same catalog on both tiers and do
not change escrow placement. Static names preserve the inner router's existing
literal path-segment contract. Dynamically learned names use the narrower
`[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9._+~-]{0,63}` grammar required by the Runtime API.

Invalid catalog URL, timing, or capacity values fail startup. Every fully
ready addition is persisted before its request-map entry is published. Admission
is independent per version: an unavailable candidate remains staged without
blocking another candidate that has reached its reserve. A candidate with no
slot remains unpublished as `capacity-exhausted`, while already accepted routes
continue to serve. Cached additions remain assigned to bounded dynamic slots, so
a restart never resets capacity usage. If the configured capacity was reduced
below the number of accepted cached additions, the router preserves those routes
and renders enough slots for the LKG projection.

The catalog is additions-only during normal operation. A snapshot that omits an
accepted name keeps that route and cache entry and reports `withdrawal-pending`.
Removal requires an explicit maintenance run with
`VERSIOND_ROUTING_CATALOG_ALLOW_REMOVALS=true`. Accepted snapshots are written
atomically under `/var/lib/gonka-router`; stale or future-dated timestamps are
diagnostic and do not revoke accepted routes. Malformed or empty source data
leaves the last-known-good projection untouched. `catalog-status --state`
exposes these persistent states for monitoring, and the entrypoint restarts an
unexpectedly exited reconciler without restarting HAProxy.

The router consumes DAPI's existing `{"versions":[...]}` response. Names must
be valid and unique, and the local projection only grows without an explicit
maintenance operation. A malformed or removal snapshot leaves the last admitted
routes unchanged. This is a local HA safety policy, not a governance rule.
The parent and inner routers use the same validated schema-1 cache contract.
A stale cache retains already accepted routes while fresh catalog convergence
is pending; malformed cache data is ignored and obtained again from DAPI, with
the static bootstrap floor remaining fail-closed.

## Tests

```bash
make -C proxy-router test-render
make -C proxy-router test-compose
make -C proxy-router test-routing
```

The routing test uses real Docker networks, HAProxy, policy workers, route-aware
router health, an unavailable router data port, and a legacy edge-api-router
fixture. It verifies failover, a policy replacement that receives a new Docker
IP, withdrawal before replacement admission, exactly-once POST execution in the
tested connection-failure path, and the unchanged edge-api routing path.
